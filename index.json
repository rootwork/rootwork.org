You can view the Slideshare or download the PDF, but the slides are simply images.\nMy background is in community organizing and social movement theory, and that’s what I’d like to talk a little bit about today.\nIn popular culture, we have two stories we usually tell about social change — two lenses in which we view advocacy and activism.\nThe first is about a charismatic leader. Gandhi led India to freedom. Or Rosa Parks, who one day was too tired to get up and inspired a city to boycott a racist public policy.\nThe second story we tell is about a spontaneous event. Something shifted in the world around us, and people responded in positive ways. Egyptians took to the square to reclaim their democracy.\nWhile both of these stories have kernels of truth — events happen, and people inspire — they are fundamentally not how social change occurs. Instead, it’s movement-building work that pushes change forward.\nRosa Parks wasn’t just tired — she was trained.\nThe Egyptian revolution didn’t just happen, it was preceded by years of student organizing.\nThe most successful social change movements didn’t just get lucky or figure out how to use the newest tools, they were built through concerted strategic planning. Our work for change can draw on that history and experience.\nCatalyst moments might be unplanned, but the infrastructure can be built.\nIn our organizations, we tend to privilege one set of actions over the other. We focus on important task-based work like website development, fundraising, communications, and the campaign strategy I just mentioned.\nBut there’s more to an organization and more to a movement than that. There’s another group of endeavors sometimes called maintenance work, and it flies under the radar even though it’s crucial to keeping our campaigns afloat.\nMaintenance work involves things like leadership development, facilitating communication, conflict resolution, anti-oppression work, and visioning, the things that fertilize our movements.\nWe often privilege task work over maintenance work. Community knowledge and strategic knowledge is devalued in favor of technical knowledge, because technical knowledge can be more easily measured.\nMeanwhile, movement-building work is disproportionately done by women, leaving men in the “important” and visible roles.\nAt its worst, a specialization of knowledge leads to accumulation of informal, unacknowledged power through gatekeeping.\nOr to put it another way, “We’ll launch that campaign when I’m ready to update the website for you.”\nIn our organizations, we should be striving toward social change, not startup culture. We should cultivate sustainable work. We should commit to anti-oppression work so we don’t replicate the unequal society we’re trying to improve. We should provide benefits rather than relying on a precarious workforce of independent contractors. We should pay our interns. We should allow staff to unionize, or become a worker-owned collective.\nAnd in general, we should remember that social change is not a business. We should be ruthless in stealing ideas from the business community, but we should not expect them to work for us just because they made people some money.\nIn closing, my one piece of advice is in addition to all the Twitter guides and fundraising how-tos in your tool belt, explore some movement history. Whether it’s Poor People’s Movements about work against economic injustice, I’ve Got the Light of Freedom or Southern Labor and Black Civil Rights about the black-led freedom struggle\nOr maybe my little article in this recent publication by Green Memes. Investigate how sustainable social change has transpired in the past, and you’ll be closer to effecting change in the future.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2014/03/online-advocacy-learn-community-organizing/","section":"blog","tags":["social change"],"title":"What online advocacy can learn from community organizing"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/","section":"year","tags":null,"title":"Archives: 2013"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/","section":"month","tags":null,"title":"Archives: May 2013"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/tags/css/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"CSS"},{"body":"This is an intervention.\nCSS is pretty simple. Classes, IDs, elements and pseudo-elements, with style definitions attached to each. Calling it a “language” is a bit of a stretch (though preprocessors like Sass fit the bill).\nBut let’s be honest, for years our stylesheets cascaded right on out to infinity.\nHuge files with table-of-contents comments to try to make some sense of it — until a quick fix got pasted down at the bottom. Brittle style definitions relying on tight coupling with HTML structure. Pieces of styles being replicated here and there for different components with similar features, without any way to tell they were related in the CSS.\nMy stylesheets were like that too, because strategies for writing CSS had barely altered since the days when it was used to change the colors of the scroll bars in Internet Explorer. Luckily, in the past couple of years both CSS architecture and CSS preprocessors came into their own.\nSMACSS, or Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS, was developed by Jonathan Snook, a featured speaker at Drupalcon Portland. I’m really excited to get the opportunity to have Jonathan speak, not only because of my personally well-dog-eared copy of SMACSS, but because Drupal itself is adopting a SMACSS approach to its CSS.\nI spoke with Jonathan about sustainable stylesheets and the future of SMACSS. For an even more detailed look, please join me at Jonathan Snook’s featured Drupalcon Portland this afternon, Tuesday, May 21 at 4:30 PM.\nIB: What’s the biggest mistake you see people making when writing CSS?\nJS: I think the biggest mistake is thinking of everything in the context of a single page. We’re no longer just building sites with a design for a home page and an inside page. We’re developing complex systems that need to work in a variety of contexts and we need a development approach that complements that.\nIB: What’s the biggest “win” you see in using the SMACSS approach? Why should frontend developers change their approach to CSS?\nJS: The biggest win is maintainability. The SMACSS methodology makes it easier to build larger projects by breaking things down into smaller components. Like the move from spaghetti code to MVC frameworks on the server side, this separation of concerns on the CSS side improves the process of putting a site or web app together.\nIB: In the last part of your book, you talk about how the SMACSS approach fits in to work using a preprocessor like Sass. There have been a lot of developments in Sass in the past year — have they had any positive effects on your use of the SMACSS approach?\nJS: With Sass, the introduction of placeholders was a positive step forward. Overall, Sass (and other preprocessors) are a great way to augment — but not replace — the way people write CSS.\nIB: What are your thoughts on BEM? Do you see it as compatible with SMACSS?\nJS: I see BEM as very compatible. BEM really enforces naming convention, which is a very important concept in SMACSS. They both take a modular approach to site development.\nIB: What are you tacking next when it comes to CSS and frontend development? Will there be a “SMACSS Part Two”? Or something else entirely?\nJS: I’d love to augment SMACSS with case studies and expand on some of the ideas in the book based on things that come up in the workshops I do. I’d also like to work on a prototyping/site development tool that uses the SMACSS concepts. We had built something like this when I was at Yahoo! that I think many people in the industry would find really useful. Hopefully I can find the time to work on it!\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/we-need-talk-about-your-stylesheets-interview-jonathan-snook-drupalcon-portland/","section":"blog","tags":["CSS","Drupal"],"title":"We need to talk about your stylesheets: An interview with Jonathan Snook at Drupalcon Portland"},{"body":"Media queries are a key part of responsive web design, because they control at what width (among other things) different CSS rules kick in.\n“Breakpoint makes writing media queries in Sass super simple,” say Mason Wendell and Sam Richard, creators of the extension to Compass, and they’re right. It’s not surprising that we’d want them to present at Drupalcon, since design in Drupal, like web design everywhere, has been embracing responsive web design as a fundamental principle. (Side note: This website is in the midst of a responsive web design overhaul. Cobbler’s children and all that.)\nI spoke to Mason and Sam about how Breakpoint makes responsive web design even easier. Don’t miss their Drupalcon Portland frontend session, “Managing Responsive Web Design with Sass and Breakpoint,” on Thursday at 10:45 AM.\nIB: What motivated you to create Breakpoint? How has it changed your own workflow?\nMW: Before Sass 3.2 came out I had written an article for The Sass Way that previewed some of it’s new features, including the ability to use variables in media queries. I created an example that baked in some names for breakpoints into a kind of “master mixin” for media queries. On my next responsive project I put the theories I’d written for that post into practice, and found that I could refine that approach. If I assigned a variable to each media query first the approach would be very flexible. Then when noticed that I wrote min-width queries way more often than any other type I set up defaults that made creating media queries very fast.\nMW: There was a side effect that I think is more useful though. By assigning names to each of my media queries I’m able to keep them in context in a much more effective way. If I some media queries to deal with the width of a nav element, and then later I add an item to that nav, I can change the value of that variable and all the associated queries are adjusted. This is even more effective when handing code back and forth within a team.\nSR: Breakpoint was created with the motivation to ease many of the pain points of working with media queries in CSS. The biggest pain point that Breakpoint solves is providing meaningful semantics to your media queries. When building content based responsive sites, early in your design process two unrelated items may happen to break at the same points, but as your project grows, those points may change and a simple find and replace will have unintended consequences. This is probably the biggest workflow win to using Breakpoint, all of your media queries now have proper semantics.\nSR: The other big win for my workflow is Breakpoint’s no-query fallback, allowing me to very easily add in fallback code for any of the media queries I write.\nIB: What can Breakpoint do that just assigning variable names to specific min-widths can’t?\nSR: For starters, Breakpoint handles much more than min-width queries. It is designed to be future friendly and currently supports all CSS level 3 and level 4 media queries. Additionally, it’s syntax is easy to use to create complex media queries, including both and and or media queries. It has native handling for all of the different media query requirement for resolution (of which you need to write at least four different queries for currently) while just writing the standard. The no-query fallbacks are a huge win as well.\nMW: The main benefit is that you can assign names and manage your media queries with variables. This helps you avoid having them scattered around your SCSS, and makes is easy to understand how they’re related and affect each other.\nMW: While Breakpoint is optimized for min-width because they’re used most often it doesn’t stop there. There are a number of shortcuts built in, for fencing min- and max- values, converting pixels to ems, and even vendor prefixed queries like resolution.\nMW: We even created a way to Breakpoint to report back to you what queries are in a particular context. Singularity GS uses this feature to kind of magically create responsive grid systems.\nSR: Of all of Breakpoint’s features, probably the least used, but most powerful is Breakpoint Context. This allows you to call a function anywhere and get the current media query context allowing for amazingly intelligent mixins and functions to be written in Sass, something unique to Breakpoint that you simply don’t have with interpolating variables.\nIB: Are there any responsive web design aspects specific to Drupal theming/frontend development that Breakpoint helps with?\nSR: There is nothing Drupal specific that Breakpoint helps with. Breakpoint, like Sass, was built to be backend independent. This means that if you are building any site, regardless of if it’s a Drupal site or a Node site or a static site, Breakpoint is able to do its job handily without being caught up in being tied to a specific backend technology.\nMW: One of the things I love about working with Sass is that it’s not Drupal-specific, and it’s meant to be used anywhere on the web. Breakpoint follows that example.\nIB: Is Breakpoint a successor to Respond-To, or will that continue to get developed?\nSR: In a way, yes and no. Respond-To was written before Breakpoint, but upon Breakpoint’s release, it was decided that our efforts should be focused on a unified Media Query engine, with Respond-To as a wrapper syntax for Breakpoint. This is how the current Respond-To project exists. As of Breakpoint 2.0, the Respond-To mixin has been incorporated into Breakpoint core, so you now can use Respond-To without needing an additional Compass extension!\nIB: Do you use Breakpoints module (in Drupal 8 core)? Or do you just do all of that through Sass?\nSR: I personally truly dislike the Breakpoint module. Every use case I’ve heard for it seems to be based on the thinking that sites have three or four breakpoints and that everything can be boiled down into an easy to use admin interface. There are no standard breakpoints, period, and good, reasonably complex responsive sites will usually have 20 or more breakpoints. Responsive cannot be done from the backend, and the Breakpoint module encourages you to do so (as does the Spark layout initiative).\nIB: Do you think any aspects of Breakpoint might get rolled directly into Sass in the future?\nMW: It’s possible, but we probably won’t move the obvious parts to the Sass language. There are some helper functions that we’ve written in Ruby that would be very useful in Sass core. Once that’s in we’ll be able to offer Breakpoint without Compass.\nSR: I do not believe Breakpoint will be rolled directly into Sass, nor would I want it to be, as it is out of scope of Sass core. As much as I like them, I even think the color functions in Sass are out of scope for it. Sass core should simply be the language and the bare minimum function base for it to be useable. Sass doesn’t ship with any mixins, and I think it should probably stay that way. That being said, Breakpoint is fairly stable; our 1.3 release stood stable for six or so months without needing any changes until we rewrote the whole thing for our 2.x release, so maybe being merged into Compass isn’t out of the question, but I do not see a need for that.\nIB: I hear in addition to Breakpoint, Sam went and created some kind of magic box of Sass called Toolkit. Want to say more about that?\nSR: Toolkit started life as RWD Kickstart, a project Mason and I kind of made up on the spot a year ago at one of the first New York Sass meetups. Its original goal was simply to be a collection of Compass templates to make pulling in media query and grid solutions together easily. Since then, it’s evolved to be more of a collection of Progressive Enhancement, Design in Browser, and Modern Web Development tools, a toolkit if you’ll let me, of useful tools. I’d say the four biggest thing that Toolkit has are a modern Clearfix mixin, progressive enhancement replace text mixins, a triangle generation mixin, and an intrinsic ratio mixin to make using intrinsic ratios super easy. It also adds *, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: border-box} and img, video { max-width: 100%; height: auto; } to your stylesheets, which are the first two things I do for any responsive project.\nSR: Toolkit’s templates have also evolved, Where originally there were five some odd different templates to choose from, now there are just two, a basic one to set up a basic partial structure, and a responsive web design one that pulls in Breakpoint 2.x for media queries and Singularity 1.x for grids.\nIB: You sure know those late twentieth-century presidents.\nMW: With a name like Breakpoint, how could I not revisit the cinema classic Point Break. Bodhi and his gang of thrill-seeking bank-robbing surfers evaded the FBI for years until the newly minted Special Agent Johnny Utah was on the case. I think we can all agree that there’s a poignant metaphor for web designer there. And some pretty sweet GIFs.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupalcon-portland-responsive-web-design-snap-breakpoint-sass/","section":"blog","tags":["CSS","Drupal"],"title":"Drupalcon Portland: Responsive web design in a snap with Breakpoint and Sass"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/categories/a11y/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"a11y"},{"body":"A new theming engine, Twig, is coming along with Drupal 8’s adoption of the Symfony framework. And it’s downright magical.\nInstead of having theme functions that have to be overridden, everything becomes an (easy to read, easy to modify) template. Instead of having to figure out render arrays, themers can use consistent template variables. And instead of having insecure output, Twig sanitizes everything by default.\nIf you’ve ever worked on a WordPress or Tumblr theme, the approach will feel pretty similar. Here’s what it looks like:\nAnd oh by the way, it’s well-documented — no small point in the Drupal community!\nSound too good to be true? Well, it almost might be, because a lot has to happen in order to get this into Drupal 8. There’s a Twig-focused sprint happening right after Drupalcon, so if you think this is great, come pitch in! Because if things don’t get done, Twig will be held until Drupal 9. No Drupal themer, veteran or newbie, kitten or human, wants that to happen.\nI spoke to Jen Lampton (with a contribution from Fabian Franz) about how Twig will result in happier veteran Drupal themers, happier new Drupal themers, and happier Drupal kittens. Be sure to show up for their featured Drupalcon session (along with Drupal CSS innovator John Albin Wilkins), “Using Twig: The new template engine in Drupal 8,” on Wednesday at 3:45 PM.\nIB: What’s one thing you’re most excited about with Twig?\nJL: Replacing the template engine with something completely different means that we get to take a good hard look at absolutely everything in the current theme system, so we can do a clean sweep.\nFF: What I love the most about Twig is the syntax, and how it cleverly makes it possible to lazy-render things. The possibilities of having an interpreted language are endless.\nIB: Can theme developers start converting/creating their themes now?\nJL: No! If you have the time to start converting your own themes, then please, please, please use the time to help us make the theme system what you want it to be — instead. There will be time to convert your themes later, but Drupal itself can only be monumentally improved right now.\nIB: Will frontend developers and themers coming from other CMSes — like WordPress — find Twig easier to use?\nJL: Yes. Front end developers coming from everywhere will find Twig easier to use. For starters, Twig looks a lot more like HTML, so if you don’t know PHP you’ll still be right at home. For people who do know PHP and don’t know Twig, there will be a learning curve, but it’s far far FAR less steep than learning about what Drupal had done to PHPTemplate.\nIB: Twig sounds great! What can people do to help make sure it happens for Drupal 8?\nJL: There are four main areas where we need help right now, as outlined in our Twig TODO wiki.\nHelp us test all the patches.\nHelp us fix issues with the patches.\nHelp us improve the markup in core (after being converted to Twig).\nHelp us clean up the rest of the theme system.\nIf people are interested in any one of these four areas, they can come to the sprint immediately following DrupalCon and get some hands-on help making Drupal better. We need all the hands we can get since we are up against some major deadlines, so please please please come help us!\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-power-twig-drupalcon-portland-featured-session/","section":"blog","tags":["Drupal","Twig"],"title":"Drupal 8 and the power of Twig: A Drupalcon Portland featured session"},{"body":"I’m a millennial, but even I remember the experience of calling the telephone operator and getting a live human to look up the number of a business or place a collect call. We have the digital means to complete lots of tasks like that today, but that doesn’t mean all of our methods are equally effective for everyone.\n“Drupal 8 will be the most accessible version of Drupal yet,” declare J. Renée Beach and Wim Leers in their Drupalcon Portland session description.\nThey’re both part of the Spark team, an initiative to improve the authoring experience in Drupal for everyone.\nSpark is more well known for things like in-place editing and a mobile friendly toolbar, (see image). But from the beginning, improving the experience for everyone has been a big priority, and one of the most exciting developments is a new aural interface.\nThat’s right, Drupal is getting a switchboard operator:\nOK, so that doesn’t look terribly exciting all on its own. But trust me, when you watch the videos of people interacting with Drupal 8 and having menus and selections read as they go, it’s pretty cool.\nWhen I spoke with J. Renée about Drupal 8 and the nature of working on accessibility, the passion for this work really shown through. I’m really looking forward to their session with Wim, “Drupal Speaks: Aural user interfaces, new Drupal 8 accessibility features,” on Wednesday at 10:45 AM. Hope to see you there!\nIB: What are we missing when we talk about accessibility right now?\nJRB: I want developers to understand that accessibility is fundamental to user interface development. We tend to talk about accessibility like we talk about gender. Both have coded values. When we speak of being gendered, we are often talking about being non-male. Male is a kind of genderless base state. So is it with accessibility. When we speak of making something accessible, we tend to refer to making an interface for blind users or for users with physical capabilities that make keyboard and mouse use difficult, as examples. Visual is a kind of accessible base state.\nWe risk “othering” folks for whom accessibility is an issue because as developers, in general, non-visual accessibility has not been a primary concern. I know what is is like to be othered. In some ways, highlighting otherness can be an effective way to bring focus to a problem. Eventually though, we need to resolve those issues and close the loop on the otherness. We can be other and also be equal. Now is the time for front end developers to start thinking about accessibility as a multi-modal effort. We no longer have the excuse that the tools and technologies available to us do not support efficient workflows for non-visual UI development.\nIB: Where is Drupal 8 going to do better?\nJRB: Most importantly, we have more individual core contributors this cycle who truly believe in addressing accessibility issues. And they are all smart, wonderful people which makes working with them a pleasure!\nFor example, take this issue about requirement warnings during installation. For a sighted user, a warning during installation is immediately apparent. The missing requirement is made distinct with color contrast. For a blind user, they must traverse every cell in the table to discover a missing requirement. Would we ever impose such a burden on a sight user through the UI? No, not without grumbles in the issue queues at least. With more contributors invested in improving these types of non-visual details, we are polishing all the rough edges — the ones we see and the ones we don’t.\nIB: How important is context in aural interfaces?\nJRB: Context is important to all interfaces. As front end developers we build templates that expose context in a predictable, consumable way. As a practice we have established and then refined patterns of visual expression over the past 30-plus years.\nMetaphors grounded visual pointer displays on a virtual desktop. We talk of visual affordances in rounded, gradient-embellished, reflective buttons. Skeumorphic designs bring our understanding of the physical world to bear on pixels and bits.\nWhere are the metaphors in aural interface design? I know of none. To me, these interfaces are flat. The metal is bare underneath them.\nPerhaps non-visual interfaces have one less level of abstraction to traverse. Maybe there’s no need to translate language into symbol and then back into language. But that little bit of designer in me, that memory of a linguist I almost was, remembers being thunderstruck with insight reading Jackendoff’s unfurling of metaphor after I had just so recently fallen smitten with the strict generative grammar of early Chomsky. Jackendoff gives us a way of understanding language that starts at basic physical dichotomies — up/down and near/far — and from there offers us a model of communication. He gives us pattern. (Early) Chomsky gave us metal. So much that we humans do starts with structure that softens with time to fit our curvy, winding nature.\nI want to believe that the aural interfaces we have today still just the awkward first attempts to build an abstract audio interface pattern language. That non-visual interface design is still working through its structuralist phase. We are still learning how to pack context into denser forms through non-visual expressions.\nIB: Will the Drupal 8 improvements have things to offer module developers?\nJRB: In Drupal 8, we are building tools that manage a couple of the trickier components of accessibility in a browser. These are:\nOutputting audio updates\nManaging tabbing in constrained workflows\nModule developers will be able to pass a string to a method called “announce” on the Drupal object and have that string read by a screen reader.\nAnother method on the Drupal object called “tabbingManager” will constrain tabbable elements on the page. A developer will select those elements, either through JavaScript methods or jQuery, and pass them to the tabbingManager. Tabbing is then constrained to those elements until the constraint is superseded or released. I know that must not be completely clear, but that’s why we’re presenting a session about aural user interfaces and how we can use these new tools to build them!\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/drupal-8-aural-interfaces-groundbreaking-accessibility-drupalcon-portland/","section":"blog","tags":["Drupal"],"title":"Drupal 8, aural interfaces and groundbreaking accessibility at Drupalcon Portland"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/tags/twig/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Twig"},{"body":"Ah, base themes.\nIf there’s an analogue to the Windows/Mac/Linux battle in Drupal land, it’s probably Zen vs. Omega vs. AdaptiveTheme.\nGarrett Dawson and John Ferris have a way out of that eternal struggle: Custom base themes. As they put it in their Drupalcon Portland session description:\n“By necessity, base themes make assumptions about how teams and individuals work. By rolling your own, you’ll become much more comfortable and informed about the Drupal theming layer, and have a better launchpad for your front-end projects.”\nHere in Portland we take home gardening and permaculture seriously, so what better place to talk about “growing your own” custom base theme!\nI spoke with John and Garrett about how creating your own base theme can make work for you and your team easier. Take a gander at their session, “Dapper Drupal: Custom Tailored Themes,” on Thursday at 2:15 PM for the full story!\nIB: Base themes that are out there make some assumptions about how you want to theme. What’s the advantage to rolling your own base theme rather than finding the theme that already makes the assumptions you do?\nJF and GD: If you can find a base theme in contrib that fits perfectly into your workflow, by all means, use it. There’s a lot of solid tools out there. We don’t want to deter people from using and contributing to them. With that said, we feel it’s unlikely a contributed base theme will be ticking all the boxes and making all the right assumptions about your workflow.\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach. Your front-end process is heavily influenced by team dynamics, contrib module choices and a whole host of other considerations. The majority of base themes cannot account for those variables like you can. We want front-end developers to take a critical look at their tools to see where they can make improvements. That may mean creating a custom base theme; a custom starter theme for use with an existing base theme; or even a set of helper modules.\nAll the popular base themes started because someone wasn’t happy with what was available at the time. The ultimate goal is increasing efficiency while improving the quality of the final HTML, CSS and JS.\nIB: Do you recommend custom base themes for big shops? Small distributed teams? Freelancers? Everyone?\nJF/GD: Yes, all of the above. At least consider it as an option. If you find yourself doing any kind of repetitive work, there’s an opportunity for improvement. The only people who should steer clear of custom base themes are those new to Drupal. You need to be familiar with the tools that are available before setting out to create your own.\nIB: Besides your the custom base themes you developed yourselves (Center and Prototype) what other custom base themes have you seen in the wild?\nJF/GD: Yes! We’ve learned a lot working with and iterating on Center and Prototype. They work well for the structure of our team and the type of work we do at Aten. However, we realize every team is unique. We were really interested in seeing how other organizations were approaching the front-end problem space. We chatted with a range of teams of varying sizes working across different industries. Everyone has their own unique set of tools based on their own strengths and constraints. We’re excited to share those with you, but you’ll just have to come and see for yourself!\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/grow-your-own-learning-custom-base-themes-drupalcon-portland/","section":"blog","tags":["Drupal"],"title":"Grow your own: Learning custom base themes at Drupalcon Portland"},{"body":" It’s fair to say that in the last year, adopting the CSS preprocessor Sass has completely changed frontend development for me. That’s a sentiment I’ve heard others express when they started using it — and I was pretty late to the party.\nI got attracted to it initially through variables. We’ve all been there when a client or a designer wants to change a color and suddenly we have to change dozens or hundreds of values across CSS.\nDale Sande captures that kind of revolution in efficiency that Sass brings, as seen in a screenshot from his upcoming presentation at Drupalcon Portland.\nBut Dale, who’s spoken plenty on Sass and organizes the Seattle Sass meetup, is taking us way past the Sass basics like variables, and that’s why I’m excited to see his presentation next week.\nAround the same time Sass came onto the scene, some thoughtful people were exploring more maintainable frontend development and CSS architecture through ideas/acronyms like OOCSS, SMACSS and BEM, and folks like Nicole Sullivan, Jonathan Snook (a Drupalcon featured speaker!), Nicolas Gallagher, and Harry Roberts.\nI spoke with Dale about Sass, object-oriented CSS and some the things he’ll be covering at Drupalcon. Be sure to join me at his session, “Sass: OO’S’CSS w/Extends and Silent Placeholders,” on Wednesday at 2:15 PM!\nIB: Some people argue SASS creates bloated code — do you see placeholders addressing that concern effectively?\nDS: Sass doesn’t create bad code. Bad coders do.\nThe whole concept of placeholder selectors was designed to fight code bloat and be a more pragmatic solution to OOCSS. In my presentation, I illustrate how using the various techniques generate code.\nThe real “ah-ha” moment comes when we see how using placeholder selectors makes it easier to manage and literally re-use code — thus reducing dreaded CSS bloat.\nIB: What’s the advantage to using silent placeholders over mixins for a set of rules?\nDS: Simply put, being able to re-use code without duplicating code. The use of mixins was the first part of being DRY with our code. Looking at the Sass it felt AWESOME! But when we looked at the output CSS, this is when we realized that we were all living a lie.\nOur CSS rules were being duplicated tens, if not hundreds of times. We weren’t being DRY, we simply put the onus of duplication on the machine.\nPlaceholder selectors embrace the one of the oldest concepts of CSS and that is to extend the CSS selector for reuse. But with traditional CSS this was difficult to do, especially when you were dealing with thousands of lines of code. Sass’ @extend directive allows developers to create name-spaced reusable chunks of code that is portable, re-usable and extendable without duplicating anything.\nIB: Do you see placeholders as helping to reduce the amount of tight coupling — scattering pieces of styles in multiple places?\nDS: While placeholder selectors are a tool that can help with scattered code, it is not the only solution. Having a file/folder structure that embraces the different types of code, e.g. CSS selectors, placeholder selectors, mixins and functions, can assist in creating reusable modulare code and maintain a process of control over the many parts.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/05/ninjas-your-code-drupalcon-portland-sass-with-extends-placeholders/","section":"blog","tags":["CSS","Drupal"],"title":"Ninjas in your code at Drupalcon Portland: Sass with extends and placeholders"},{"body":"The big news at Drupalcon Portland is that, for the first time at a Drupalcon, we’re having separate frontend and user experience (UX) tracks.

If only charities were run more like businesses, he says — with high executive pay and less belief in large “overhead” being a stand-in for inefficiency — they’d be able to do more.\nDan follows in the long tradition of successful businessmen (it’s almost always men) arriving on the nonprofit scene talking loudly and listening rarely.\nHis ideas are wrong almost by design, because Dan isn’t interested in making nonprofits more powerful; he’s interested in making society more receptive to unrestrained business — nonprofits, in this case, are merely a proxy.\n“He is not a credible defender of nonprofits because he doesn’t seem to really care for them. He appears not to grasp the notion that markets fail—and that one of nonprofits’ primary roles is to address those failures, not mimic corporations. He has consistently disparaged nonprofits. In a Harvard Business Review blog, he wrote that he’d be hard pressed to think of any business that wasn’t making more of a positive difference in society than nonprofits.”\n— Phil Buchanan, The Chronicle of Philanthropy\n“Just as he makes a fetish out of unrestrained capitalism, he makes a fetish out of cash over other means of securing happiness and satisfaction at work. How insulting to think that, if we make less pay than our for profit counterparts, we must be less creative, talented, intelligent and less capable of helping others.”\n— Ken Berger, Charity Navigator\nThe entire approach is based on the scarcity-model, zero-sum game that people like to play with charities. In the past I’ve referred to this as nonprofit deathmatch.\nYet lots of research has shown people who donate once are more likely to donate again, even to other organizations in the same field — it’s why some nonprofits sell their lists. And the same principle is at work with advocacy: get people interested and they’ll keep taking action.\nGetting away from the scarcity model allows organizations to build movements instead of just lists.\nIt’s not suprising that his views are so limited when he consistently groups all organizations into “nonprofits” or “charities” without recognizing the huge differences among them.\nService organizations have very different goals from advocacy-based organizations, to say nothing of institutional nonprofits like universities, hospitals and museums. But they’re all just the “nonprofit sector” to him.\n“To Mr. Pallotta, it’s the total amount of funds raised that is the ultimate measure. His defense of CEO pay justifies compensation in the context of revenue, apparently assuming that a charity that has more money will inevitably get better results.”\n— Phil Buchanan, The Chronicle of Philanthropy\n“Myth #1: There are $400,000 talents. The first falsehood is that there are people who are just worth more. Defending wide inequality relies upon the notion that some people are worth much more, based on training, ability, or certain special qualities. This notion makes inequality appear legitimate to people at all levels, and thereby harder to redress. The use of the phrase ‘low-wage worker,’ instead of ‘worker who is paid a low wage,’ hints at a peculiarly American sleight of hand: Someone’s place in the wage structure is an indicator of their true merit.”\n— Michelle Kweder, Gerald Denis, and Maureen Scully, Stanford Social Innovation Review\nDan also has little use for any vision of social change, or any apparent understanding of social movements, since none that could be called successful have in any way fit his vision. Because Dan’s vision isn’t one of social change, it’s one of a perpetuation of wealth, with nonprofits simply one more business sector in which to advertise.\n.@danpalotta The ? I have is, why should NPOs be more like biz? Isn’t what’s necessary to change the game, not make more of the same? #13NTC\n— Jenn Yoo (@jooy8) April 12, 2013\n“He makes more references to Steve Jobs, Apple, and its products—the index lists seven, though I counted more—in Charity Case than to any nonprofit organization. Yet he says he is rising to the defense of nonprofits: comparing the ‘movement’ he seeks to lead to the civil-rights movement.”\n— Phil Buchanan, The Chronicle of Philanthropy\nCapitalism isn’t the solution. It’s the problem, and many of us are fighting it.\nCapitalism created inequalities, but we won’t let NPOs use capitalist tools to address them—missing a logical step? #13ntc\n— Jenn Yoo (@jooy8) April 12, 2013\n“[A] theme in the book is Dan’s idealization of capitalism almost as a God that can lead to self fulfillment and ‘stunning change’ through the wonderful motive of personal gain.”\n— Ken Berger, Charity Navigator\n#13NTC Lots to agree with in Dan Palotta’s plenary, but as an anti-capitalist I want to destroy the system, not compete w/it.\n— Laura Shapiro (@laurajshapiro) April 12, 2013\n“He co-opts our national conversation about income inequality to advance his goals and the goals of a socio-economic elite that is content to believe in meritocracy and their own meritoriousness. We argue that it is misguided to base the pay of executives in inequality-alleviating nonprofits on ideological myths that have done much to reproduce and legitimate inequality.”\n— Michelle Kweder, Gerald Denis, and Maureen Scully, Stanford Social Innovation Review\nIt’s no wonder Dan is so popular among the TED crowd — business leaders and wealthy technologists who can see a product in every social trend.\nWhat’s more mystifying is why Dan Pallotta would be popular among nonprofits, activists, and social changemakers. It’s clear Dan has no substantive message for them.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/04/uncharitable-how-businesses-co-opt-nonprofits-undermine-their-potential/","section":"blog","tags":["social change"],"title":"Uncharitable: How businesses co-opt nonprofits and undermine their potential"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2013/02/","section":"month","tags":null,"title":"Archives: February 2013"},{"body":"Tomorrow at 1PM Eastern/10AM Pacific, Johanna Bates and I will be co-hosting the monthly Nonprofit Drupal Community of Practice discussion and Q\u0026amp;A call.\nThis is a free conference call, sponsored by the Nonprofit Technology Network (NTEN) but open to anyone.

It now goes by the name Domain Registry Services, the better to be globally misleading, I guess. It still has its old domain name, droa.com. I have no reason to think the facts contained in the original post below aren\u0026rsquo;t still true.\nI know how registering a website domain goes in a small nonprofit: A volunteer or an intern or a staff person’s nephew set up the website years ago and registered the domain somewhere — which perhaps you only found out when it suddenly expired, the email address renewal messages were being sent to having long ago been deleted or moved. Remembering to renew your domain is probably something you learned (perhaps the hard way) to schedule on your calendar, to make sure the website doesn’t go down — as it did once for me — when the single “tech person” on staff is away at a conference.\nDomain Registry of America \"notice\" Into this confusion steps Domain Registry of America, a bottomfeeding company that intentionally misleads low-information website owners into vastly overpaying for their domain registration by switching to their “service.”\nYou don’t need to and shouldn’t register your nonprofit website with Domain Registry of America — don’t be fooled!\nHere’s how it works: Domain Registry of America sends the owner of a website domain an official-looking “expiration notice” (pictured at right), urging the owner to “act today” to prevent “loss of your online identity making it difficult for your customers and friends to locate you.”\nHow does it get your mailing address? Domain Registry of America trawls “whois” records, the official listings of contact information every website has.\nMany domain registrars offer “whois privacy” or “whois anonymization,” enabling registrants to substitute the registrar’s own contact information for yours. But nonprofits, either because of a need for transparency or a lack of knowledge about the service, often have their official mailing address listed.\nDomain Registry of America isn’t any kind of official or government-sanctioned company (I’ve intentionally refrained from referring to it as the Domain Registry of America), although that’s clearly the impression they’re aiming for with their name.\nWhen a harried nonprofit staffer gets a letter that says “domain name expiration notice” in big letters at the top, they might well think back to the last time their website unexpectedly expired and send back their “renewal” — not realizing they’ve unintentionally transferred their domain.\nNow to be fair, Domain Registry of America carefully words its documents to specify that this “is not a bill” and that responding will “switch your domain name registration.” But they’re clearly banking on people not reading closely.\nDomain Registry of America vastly overcharges for domain registrations — $35 per year with their “service,” whereas reputable registrars usually charge between $10 and $15 per year.\nThis company can’t compete on price or service; their entire business model is built on swindling people into switching their registration. Because nonprofits are more likely to be low-information customers in this space, and because they’re likely to have their real contact information listed, nonprofits are at particular risk of being exploited by Domain Registry of America. I’ve seen at least two nonprofits nearly go through with the switch before they realized what was happening.\nDon’t let it happen to your nonprofit.

Though the backend of a site may be impeccable, the frontend experience gives the user the first impression of an organization or company. Without a good frontend experience, a site can turn users away. Let’s discover ways in which we can connect our knowledge of different frontend tools and techniques with Drupal — and make Drupal a better experience for all users.\nMain Themes\nThe importance of frontend development in creating websites + web apps What frontend developers need to know to work well with backend devs, PMs, UX, Content Strategists Preparing frontend devs for D8 and Twig Frontend for mobile Using frontend frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap Speeding up the design process Frontend development for multilingual sites Audience\nFrontend developers Backend devs that do Frontend work PMs that work with Frontend devs User Experience (UX)The User Experience process is key to the success of the development of websites and web applications. From user research, interviews and analytics, we learn what the user actually wants and needs; not what we assume they want. At this year’s DrupalCon we present a new User Experience track to show our community’s dedication to user needs.\nMain Themes\nExplaining what user experience is and why it’s important UX for mobile and tablet, Responsive UX Speeding up the design process using UX tools and techniques UX for multilingual sites - especially RTL Content Strategy Audience\nUX professionals - Drupal UX professionals outside of Drupal Backend devs that are interested in UX Frontend devs interested in UX For the frontend track, global track chair John Ferris and I are looking for balance among three big areas: CSS and CSS metalanguages like Sass and LESS; jQuery and JavaScript; and Drupal 8’s new template engine, Twig.

For individuals already on Facebook, it can compile a detailed profile of you around the web, based on what you visit (again, whether or not you click the button) and serve you or your friends particular ads on Facebook as a result. For those who are not on Facebook, or who aren’t logged in, it can still tie the profile to your IP address, and could theoretically link that information to you, should you subsequently show up on Facebook.\nThis isn’t unique to FacebookMost “free” third-party apps do exactly the same thing, although few have the reach of Facebook. The other big player is Google, who tracks you (by IP address) using Google Analytics, which many websites have installed in exchange for free website statistics, and tracks you (by Google profile) using Google’s new “+1” button released as part of the Google Plus social network. Since Google makes so much of its money from advertising, its interest in knowing which sites you visit is pretty self-explanatory.\nOther social networks’ widgets, such as Twitter’s “Tweet” button, the Pinterest button, etc. also are certainly tracking who is accessing them, but to date there have been fewer examples of them using this information to build profiles of people. Social “plugin” applications, like AddThis, ShareThis and Disqus also compile profiles of people as a way to present them what they think will be the most useful social network buttons (and in some cases links to other content), but it’s less clear whether they’ve been using that information for any other purposes.\nOrganizations concerned about the privacy of their visitors — especially those at risk of being tracked by repressive governments who could lean on social networking companies to release user data — should carefully weigh whether a given social widget is worth the risk in privacy. Moreover, these organizations should absolutely provide a privacy policy that specifically lays out what’s being collected and by whom, and may also want to consider suggesting ways for those at risk to circumvent this data tracking.\nSeveral organizations I’ve seen have prominently linked to the Tor Project, and there are good resources from the EFF and Ethan Zuckerman on using Tor for anonymous blogging. There are also several Firefox plugins that anonymize your browsing. Any of these methods would defeat tracking by social networking widgets.\nA two-click solution for websitesFor organizations that want to ensure their users are only tracked by social networking websites if they explicitly opt-in, there’s an exciting new development.\nLast week, as a response to the German privacy commissioner’s declaration against social networking buttons, German website Heise has released a script that disables social networking buttons by default.\nThe two stages of the social networking buttons (each operates independently). Note the Facebook button is localized in German. The script renders three social networking buttons — Facebook’s Like, Google’s +1 and Twitter’s Tweet — as greyed-out images hosted locally on the website. After flicking a virtual switch, site visitors enable the actual social networking button, which calls the web servers of Facebook, Google or Twitter and would thus trigger the data collection. There’s also a handy settings button to the right, that allows you to permanently opt-in to one or all of the services for that site. You can see it in use at the bottom of the post where they announce it.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2011/09/two-click-button-foils-facebook-tracking-new-tool-privacy-concerned-nonprofits/","section":"blog","tags":["Facebook","Google Plus","Twitter","privacy"],"title":"Two-click button foils Facebook tracking, a new tool for privacy-concerned nonprofits"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/tags/activism/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"activism"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2011/08/","section":"month","tags":null,"title":"Archives: August 2011"},{"body":"Tonight at Philly NetSquared I gave a short presentation on Google Plus and its implications for nonprofits and social change work.

In the meantime you could try to circumvent this by creating a \u0026ldquo;person\u0026rdquo; with the name of an organization, but just like with Facebook, that risks having your profile deleted. (More on that in a moment.)\nOne positive aspect of this is that it gets easier to organize among people you know. Until now, social networks have basically had two models: Public profiles that don\u0026rsquo;t require real names, like MySpace and Twitter, and private profiles that do require real names, like Facebook.\nWith Google Plus, profiles are both public and under people\u0026rsquo;s real names, meaning that if you have a list of donors, supporters or volunteers you could conceivably find each one who has a Google Plus profile relatively easily. (LinkedIn has a similar setup, but is largely used for job-seeking and, unlike Google Plus, requires an account in order to see profiles \u0026ndash; so at best they are only semi-public.)\nProfessionalizing communicationsIf you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with The Cathedral \u0026amp; the Bazaar you\u0026rsquo;ll recognize the concepts of formal and informal communication. Unlike communication among friends, Google Plus is designed to formalize communications.\nIn the same way you might segment or target an email to a particular list of supporters\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;you can make the same sort of targeted post through Google Plus:\n(Community) organizingWhile this is helpful for one-to-one communications, it means organizing in a group or collective voice \u0026ndash; common in spaces like Facebook Groups, Twitter hashtags, and blogging circles \u0026ndash; is more difficult.\nOrganic groups simply don\u0026rsquo;t have a mode to interact or connect, with the minor exception of in a post\u0026rsquo;s comments. That said, if you know who your \u0026ldquo;network connectors\u0026rdquo; are, you might have success at creating viral messages. Google Plus is oriented around a \u0026ldquo;multi-hub small world\u0026rdquo; concept. (Here\u0026rsquo;s a PDF of Valdis Krebs and June Holley discussing and illustrating these concepts.)\nOn requiring real namesGoogle Plus, like Facebook before it, has taken the position that all profiles must be linked to a single actual human person. No pseudonyms, no fictional characters, no group identities, no profiles of pets or inanimate objects, no creative or destructive bots. For some online organizers, in contrast to the chaos of Twitter or MySpace this might seem like a welcome shift.\nIndeed, Google CEO Eric Schmidt said last year,\nOne of the errors that the Internet made a long time ago is that there was not an accurate and non-revocable identity-management service. \u0026hellip; And the best example of an identity-management service today that\u0026rsquo;s reasonably reliable is Facebook.\u0026quot;\nHowever it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember what gets left behind when we require real names in a social network.\nFirst: It\u0026rsquo;s dangerous for some people. Survivors of domestic violence, political activists in many societies around the world, marginalized folks such as LGBT people, and anyone who has reason to be anonymous online will simply not be able to participate. Researcher danah boyd has gone so far as to call Google Plus\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;nymwars\u0026rdquo; policy \u0026ldquo;an abuse of power\u0026rdquo;:\nThe people who most heavily rely on pseudonyms in online spaces are those who are most marginalized by systems of power. “Real names” policies aren’t empowering; they’re an authoritarian assertion of power over vulnerable people.\nThe Geek Feminism Wiki has an extensive entry on who is harmed by \u0026ldquo;real names\u0026rdquo; policies.\nSecond is the loss of creativity \u0026ndash; and creative activism \u0026ndash; when we demand that people tie their writings to a legal identity. (Boyd points out that somehow Facebook\u0026rsquo;s strict policy on real names has never required Lady Gaga to identify as Stefani Germanotta.)\nIn the context of social movements, we sometimes remember organizers through real names (Martin Luther King, Jr.; Mohandas Gandhi) but often we know them through names other than what might have been their legal identity: Malcolm X, Mother Jones, Sylvia Rivera, or Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross and known throughout her work as \u0026ldquo;Moses\u0026rdquo;).\nActivists often use \u0026ldquo;movement names\u0026rdquo; of one type or another, like the Chinese pro-democracy activist Michael Anti, recently deleted under Facebook\u0026rsquo;s policy. Jillian C. York points out at the EFF that successful online organizing is often done under a kind of group pseudonym, as with the Egyptian uprising originating in posts on the \u0026ldquo;We Are All Khaled Said\u0026rdquo; Facebook page. And of course the use of \u0026ldquo;handles\u0026rdquo; online is older than the Web itself \u0026ndash; arguably older than the Internet, if you consider communication tools like ham radio.\nSome of us would argue that far from being an \u0026ldquo;error\u0026rdquo; as Google\u0026rsquo;s Schmidt would have it, online use of pseudonymous, anonymous, temporary, artistic, or otherwise \u0026ldquo;unofficial\u0026rdquo; identities has been a core reason for the Internet\u0026rsquo;s growth and strength. So if this does represent a broader shift toward identity-focused social networks, activists will need to adapt and, in some cases, circumvent these policies.\nUpdate, Oct. 5, 2015: The EFF has launched an initiative called The Nameless Coalition, calling on all social networks to step back from \u0026ldquo;real name\u0026rdquo; policies.\nGoogle Plus HangoutsIn addition to Google Plus profiles, Google has launched a new video-chatting system called Google+ Hangouts. This could be useful to online organizers both for quick collaboration with colleagues and for impromptu webinars with supporters. Although there are participation limits, for small groups this offers a welcome no-cost alternative to platforms like WebEx or GoToMeeting.\nConclusionWhenever I talk about online organizing, I emphasize that it\u0026rsquo;s important to go where your people are.\nThere are aspects of every social network I like and don\u0026rsquo;t like, as an organizer and as a participant. It\u0026rsquo;s absolutely true that online social networks are seeking to monetize our friendships, volunteer us to generate content for their platforms, and sell the data they collect on us \u0026ndash; the oft-repeated truism that \u0026ldquo;if you\u0026rsquo;re not paying for the product, you are the product.\u0026rdquo; But as an organizer, I go on Facebook the same way that in earlier eras organizers might have gone to churches or pubs: Not because those are places they\u0026rsquo;d personally hang out but because that\u0026rsquo;s where the people are.\nSo don\u0026rsquo;t be swayed by \u0026ldquo;shiny object syndrome\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; if your supporters, fellow activists, or sympathetic communities aren\u0026rsquo;t showing up on Google Plus, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason for you to prioritize it. As with any online platform, your organizing strategy should come first, technology second.\nResourcesGoogle Plus and nonprofits/activism Google+ and Nonprofits, Nonprofit Tech 2.0 Security and Control: Early thoughts on Google+, Amy Sample Ward Charities Explore Potential of Google+ Social Network, Chronicle of Philanthropy What Google+ Means for Political Advocacy and Campaigning, Colin Delany, e.politics Google+ for Crowdsourcing Crisis Information, Crisis Mapping and Disaster Response, Patrick Meier Ways Google+ Can Help Nature and Wildlife Lovers, Adam Jack, National Wildlife Federation The promise of Google+ for organizing, Adina Levin General Google Plus resources How to Use Google Plus, ReadWriteWeb How Is Google+ Like Twitter And Facebook?, MediaBistro A Guide to Google+ Privacy, Lifehacker Doing Good on Google Plus Nonprofit Tech folks on Google Plus \u0026lsquo;Nymwars\u0026rsquo; real-name debate Real Name Policies Are an Abuse of Power, danah boyd A Case for Pseudonyms, Jillian C.

The project runs from Dec. 15 to 19, and includes five charities: The Nature Conservancy, charity: water, Doctors Without Borders, Un Techo para mi País, and Room to Read. Google will donate a combined total of up to $1 million to the five charities.\nTo have your Chrome tabs count, you must first install a small extension to your copy of Chrome. There’s a maximum of 250 tabs per day, and one tab per second, that count toward your cause. You also must have a Google account to submit your totals.\nWhat I like about itIt’s great that Google is directing money to nonprofits, and not the usual milquetoast public awareness charities, but organizations that do good, concrete things. And it’s nice that on the Chrome for a Cause page, they have links to “donate directly” under the description of each organization.\nIt’s also nice that people who participate in Chrome for a Cause get to choose — from Google’s list of five charities — where they want their portion of the money generated to go.\nWhat I’m less thrilled aboutThe cleverness of it is lost on me. “We’ll donate money for every tab you open, if you download an extension for it,” seems like if a car dealer said, “Hey, for the month of December, every time you open the back left door of your car, I’ll donate 10 cents to a charity that you choose. (But you have to come in to the dealership to get a counter installed on that door.)”\nI get that it’s tied to the use of the browser, and anything that gets people to use the browser more (and set up Google accounts if they don’t have them) is a plus for them. So it makes sense for Google to put the tabs-for-charity schtick on this project, but I don’t see how it makes any kind of sense at all to the public. Which leads me to…\nIt feels creepy that Google is exploiting the holiday season of goodwill to get more usage out of its browser. I know that corporations don’t make donations to nonprofits without getting something in return, but this seems more gratuitous than usual. And, of course, it could breed the ultimate form of “slacktivism” — ineffective digital activism — in which opening a tab to donate a few cents assuages a person’s sense of needing to contribute to making the world a better place.\nNot even a glancing mention on their page of how much is donated for each tab. Once you download the extension, it calculates how much your tabs have donated so far, in things rather than dollars (e.g. 0.3 trees; the full breakdown is on their blog), so it’s hard to know exactly how much each tab is worth in monetary terms. But even measuring it in what it will buy, why should we have to install the extension in order to find out what our possible impact will be?\nIt promotes the idea of organizational competition — the nonprofit deathmatch. Take a look at the screenshot above: You can either donate 9 vaccinations, or 23 books, or one person’s clean water. I know that these kinds of competitions are all the rage — they even have a name, crowdsourcing philanthropy — but it’s frustrating to me how it’s rooted in a scarcity model, in which organizations must compete rather than collaborate. I’m sure, for instance, that each of these nonprofits is encouraging their members to “donate tabs” to them, rather than others.\nIn fact, since Google has capped its donation at $1 million, and it’s relatively certain they will reach that amount given their reach, what participants are really voting for is allocation. “We’ve got a million dollars; vote with your tabs on what percentage should go to The Nature Conservancy,” they’re saying. So every vote to one organization takes money away from another.\nHow it could be betterBe transparent about what the impact is. Google should say, on the Chrome for Cause page itself, how many tabs you have to open to plant a tree (for instance).\nIntegrate concrete actions from the charities. Doctors Without Borders doesn’t just ask people for money — they have, for instance, a big campaign to pressure governments not to prevent affordable generic medicines from being exported to the Global South, and another advocating for humanitarian food aid that provides adequate nutrition. At the end of each day, when a person submits their votes, why not end with something like “Great! Now here are more things you can do to support this charity…”\nPick one charity each week/month/season. This might be a little controversial, since more exposure for more nonprofits seems like a good thing, and part of this project’s appeal is the ability for people to pick where their money goes. But by acting as a kind of “matching grant” for a nonprofit — “We’ll donate $1 million to this organization, if our users open at least 1 million tabs this week” — Google can generate exposure for the organization and its browser, without forcing groups into the boxing ring against one another.\nPick one charity field each week/month/season. Instead of choosing a single environmental group for its donation, Google could choose to donate money equally to five or ten nonprofits in the same sector. This would encourage collaboration between nonprofits working on the same issue to work together in asking their supporters to participate.\nSupport nonprofits year-round. It’s cute that Google is donating some money in December, to (sort of) coincide with the holidays, but there’s no reason they can’t do this for longer than a week. By making it an ongoing project and cycling through different organizations, Google can donate money to nonprofits, but also give its far more lucrative asset: attention.\nWhat are your thoughts on Chrome for a Cause?\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/12/google-chrome-cause-nonprofit-deathmatch-strikes-again/","section":"blog","tags":null,"title":"Google Chrome for a cause, or, nonprofit deathmatch strikes again"},{"body":" If you\u0026rsquo;re a nonprofit with a mailing address, you may have already received the card in the mail from Facebook: An invitation to claim your organization\u0026rsquo;s Facebook Places page. Facebook Places allows people to \u0026ldquo;check in\u0026rdquo; when they\u0026rsquo;re at your organization, publicizing you to their friends. Places also allows companies to offer \u0026ldquo;deals\u0026rdquo; to people who check in (like 10% off), although how that applies to a nonprofit is less clear.\nIf you already had a Facebook Page, when you go to claim your Facebook Place, you\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to merge the two.\nThis new, merged page will look a little different from your old page. Among other differences, what were formerly tabs across the top of your page will now be links underneath your profile picture, similar to the new Facebook Profiles.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s where the trouble starts: On your new merged Facebook Page — as the picture above shows — you will no longer be able to specify a default landing tab.\nDefault landing tabs are a powerful way to convert visitors to fans. Instead of new visitors simply being dumped on your Wall, nonprofits (and other companies) could create custom tabs, welcoming new visitors, introducing them to the organization, and encouraging them to \u0026ldquo;Like\u0026rdquo; the nonprofit.\nEarlier this year, Facebook announced they were dropping support for new custom tabs that used Facebook Markup Language (FBML), although you could still specify a particular application tab as your landing page, including custom-page-creating applications. Indeed, a custom landing tab was recommended as a Facebook best practice for nonprofits.\nNow, however, it appears all visitors to a nonprofit\u0026rsquo;s Facebook Page will be directed to the Wall. What\u0026rsquo;s more, with tabs being de-emphasized by their move to smaller links under your profile, it\u0026rsquo;s less obvious how new visitors can find out more about your organization.\nSince at the moment this only appears to affect Places pages, and any existing Pages merged with a Place, it\u0026rsquo;s unclear whether this is simply a roll-out bug or something more long-term. But given that Facebook first removed the default landing tab a few months ago, reinstating it after an uproar — but only \u0026ldquo;temporarily\u0026rdquo; — I would guess that this is the direction of things on Facebook.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible that this might only apply to pages in some categories, e.g. nonprofits but not companies; I don\u0026rsquo;t have access to any company Facebook pages to investigate this on. It appears a default landing tab has never been available on things categorized as Community Pages — initially auto-generated from interests listed on profiles.\nIt appears that default landing tabs are not available on Places pages — or any traditional Pages \u0026ldquo;merged\u0026rdquo; with Places. My prediction is that it won\u0026rsquo;t stick around for the rest of the Pages on Facebook.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not clear to me what the advantage of this is to Facebook, other than a general \u0026ldquo;standardness of experience\u0026rdquo; for users. Yet without any way to (substantially) customize the Wall, this seems like a net loss for both organizations and regular users. New visitors will no longer have an easy way to be introduced to an organization, and organizations will have to carefully cultivate their Wall to — at any moment — appeal to both current fans and new visitors.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what possible solutions out there, although one might be to make sure your Page\u0026rsquo;s image/logo quickly communicates exactly what your nonprofit is about.\nWhat are your thoughts on these changes to Facebook?\nNote: If you blog about this, feel free to re-use the image above, with credit.

I think he\u0026rsquo;s right.\nMen aren\u0026rsquo;t to blame for the lack of representation by women in technology. Nor, clearly, are women to blame. What causes this disparity? One word: Sexism.\n\u0026ldquo;But wait!\u0026rdquo; you cry. \u0026ldquo;Surely there must be someone carrying out this sexism.\u0026rdquo; And indeed, that\u0026rsquo;s true — many individual men, and some women, often put forth ideas or enact policies that are rooted in sexism.\nBut sexism is bigger than any one person; it\u0026rsquo;s a system in which our entire society — certainly the privileged, Western technology community — is enmeshed.\nToo often, such systematic discrimination as treated as discrete, individual acts, disconnected from the larger reality. And so Arrington can complain:\nEvery damn time we have a conference we fret over how we can find women to fill speaking slots.\nBy attempting to fill a quota, he thinks he can inoculate himself (or his conference) against the charge of sexism. (He then makes the absurd point that, really, women are getting annoyed by being asked to speak at conferences all the time — which tends to undo that inoculation a small bit.)\nMen are privileged most directly by sexism, of course, which is why Arrington\u0026rsquo;s post is so galling. He suggests \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; need women \u0026ldquo;who go out and start companies\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;complain about how there are too few women in tech,\u0026rdquo; as if justice in the technology community and the larger society is only the job of those who are marginalized, and never the ones who hold power.\nPart of this is due to the retreat from full-fledged feminism into what Tim Wise has called \u0026ldquo;the diversity trap,\u0026rdquo; in which a commitment only to \u0026ldquo;different backgrounds\u0026rdquo; motivates any kind of diversity. He\u0026rsquo;s writing about racism and affirmative action, but the movement is the same — away from working to end sexism or racism, and toward an anodyne pledge to provide different perspectives. Wise quotes then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan, upon signing affirmative action into law in 1974:\nTime and experience have shown that laws and edicts of non-discrimination are not enough. Justice demands that each and every citizen consciously adopt and accentuate a commitment to affirmative action, which will make equal opportunity a reality.\nProviding opportunity alone won\u0026rsquo;t work when the playing field is already tilted. Simply inviting speakers from a field from which women have been systematically filtered since birth is too late in the game.\nArrington makes the mind-boggling assertion that women are at an advantage, because there are so few of them that the press wants to write about the ones who \u0026ldquo;make it.\u0026rdquo; This is the \u0026ldquo;talented tenth\u0026rdquo; turned on its head — that because a few individuals have struggled against overwhelming odds toward success, and that the media naturally wants to cover such extraordinary stories, the institutional oppression that existed to make those stories exceptional in the first place somehow disappears. As the death threats against tech writer Kathy Sierra demonstrated, straight-up sexism still holds sway among large parts of this male-domainted field.\nIn the sub-field of nonprofit technology, many if not most of the people I look to are women: Beth Kanter, Amy Sample Ward, Michelle Murrain, Alexandra Samuel, Marnie Webb, Allyson Kapin, Deborah Elizabeth Finn, Allison Fine, Debra Askanase, Katrin Verclas, Britt Bravo, Laura Quinn, Mary Joyce, Holly Ross, Jocelyn Harmon, Carie Lewis, Rebecca Leaman, Danielle Brigida, Christine Egger, Heather Mansfield, Shireen Mitchell, Nancy Schwartz, Ruby Sinreich, Susan Tenby, danah boyd, Nancy Scola, Kivi Leroux Miller, Judith Freeman, Jordan Dossett, Roz Lemieux, Wendy Harman, Eve Simon, Alnisa Allgood, Jean Russell, Susan Gordon, Katya Andresen, Maddie Grant, Margaux O\u0026rsquo;Malley — and that\u0026rsquo;s just off the top of my head (sorry if I missed anyone).\nYet even in this space, women leaders are repeatedly judged on their appearance. In the nonprofit field as a whole, despite there being more women than men in leadership, they\u0026rsquo;re still paid less across the board, although the gap is slowly shrinking. In part this may explain the success of women in this field, as any kind of social work is seen as women\u0026rsquo;s work.\nArrington is feeling put-upon because he\u0026rsquo;s experiencing women who point out the inequity in representation and leadership as a personal attack on him. It\u0026rsquo;s not that unusual of a response — it\u0026rsquo;s the same experience white folks have when people of color talk about racism, straight people have when queers demand equal treatment, and able-bodied individuals have when persons with disabilities expect equal access.\nThis is how oppression is set up — forcing individuals to compete against one another as individuals and rendering its pervasive influence invisible.\nMichael Arrington is right to be outraged. But the outrage should be focused on the sexism that keeps both men and women down.\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s women who bear the overwhelming amount of oppression from sexism, it\u0026rsquo;s a force that inhibits men\u0026rsquo;s growth as well. Men are expected to take on unbelievable obstacles, toil without complaint and settle for stunted emotional connections to family and friends.\nMany successful men, when confronted with evidence of institutionalized sexism, feel that their accomplishments are being degraded, because they had to struggle mightily under such harsh conditions.\nWhat too many men miss is the reality that the system under which they face such inhumane expectations is the same one that limits the potential of women.\nOf course, there are individual men and women who help to support such a system. Their actions are rightly be identified and they should be given the support and resources to help to change these actions. But changing individual actions isn\u0026rsquo;t enough by itself — the system must be confronted as a whole.\nThe BlogHer, Women Who Tech, She\u0026rsquo;s Geeky and WebGrrls conferences are one component, as a place for women to strategize and support one another; continually pressing for more visibility for women at tech conferences dominated by men who are simply unaware of women techies is another component.\nWhat would be even more exciting? A conference of male-identified folks interested in supporting women who take on positions of leadership in the tech community. Part of that involves men looking at what gets in the way of them supporting more women in \u0026ldquo;their\u0026rdquo; space, and men working through that might not always look pretty to women. But belittling women who point out systematic inequities as Arrington does is a reactionary response to being asked to account for one\u0026rsquo;s privilege.\nThis needs to be an effort undertaken by both women and men, not for some vague goal of \u0026ldquo;diverse voices\u0026rdquo; but as a way to realize all of our potentials in technology and beyond.\nUpdates: Allyson Kapin has a great list of specific suggestions to address this issue, and Michael Arrington followed up by saying he knows more needs to be done, but he might delete the post in favor of something \u0026ldquo;far less painful.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s likely that to really address sexism — if that is what he wants to do — he\u0026rsquo;ll have to face some painful truths, however. Jon Pincus says it much more succinctly: \u0026ldquo;Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s hard. Take some responsibility.\u0026rdquo;\nP.S. It\u0026rsquo;s worth pointing out that Allyson Kapin, Shireen Mitchell, Jocelyn Harmon and I are proposing a session on just this topic at next year\u0026rsquo;s Nonprofit Technology Conference: To Diversity and Beyond! Engagement, Accountability and Nonprofits. We hosted a similar discussion earlier this year.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2010/08/too-few-women-tech-blame-sexism/","section":"blog","tags":["social change","community"],"title":"Too few women in tech?

The methods and tactics of online activists — be they individuals or international nonprofits with hundreds of staff — are drawn on social change movements and community organizing strategies that have been tried, experimented with, failed, tweaked, and tried again, long before the Internet existed.\nYet there’s often a disconnect between what’s seen as online activism — referred to as “slacktivism,” sometimes accurately but oftentimes sloppily — and community-based social change. And that’s what I’m covering today at the 2010 Nonprofit Technology Conference, along with Debra Askanase and Amy Sample Ward, in a session called Bringing Community Organizing Into Online Campaigns.\nWhat I mean by community organizingThe idea of community organizing has always been weighted with both political implications and social context, and so one person’s interpretation of what “counts” as community organizing — and what its implications are — will vary from the next.\nFor my purposes here, I’m using community organizing as the idea that individuals have more power to create change by coming together than by acting alone. Community organizing empowers these individuals, creates long-term change and challenges the structure of power.\nPreviously I’ve argued that with the rise of “web 2.0,” everybody is learning how to be a community organizer. The principles of how to mobilize friends and neighbors around a particular issue — whether it’s a social cause or a hot party — are being learned every time someone creates a Facebook event.\nSo I think it’s reasonable to look at how traditional, on-the-street community organizing can inform purposeful online activism. Once we move beyond the “blast all your friends with a link to a petition” phase, there are concrete strategies to which we can turn. And many of those strategies are drawn directly from a century or more of social mobilization.\nPrinciples of community organizingThere are five primary ideas in which traditional community organizing is rooted: movement-building, strategy, community accountability, going where the people are, and cultivating leadership. There are more principles and strategies to be sure (and you may disagree whether these five are at the top), but I see these as having the most to say to online activism.\nOrganizing for a movementCommunity organizing is based on long-term strategy. “Empowerment” — that is, facilitating the realization among individuals and communities that they have the power to effect change — is not something you expect to occur overnight.\nHow this relates to online activism: Every action should be pointing people toward a greater goal. It’s straightfoward enough to get people out to a single event, or taking a single online action. But cultivating those individuals so they see their action as part of a long-term campaign is something that takes…\nStrategy, strategy, strategyI’ve written before about the fact that social media isn’t about doing less organizing, it’s about doing it better. A theory of social change is critical to an individual or organization engaging in online activism. Will signing this petition against the war put pressure on elected leaders to alter policies? Will this upcoming rally (or “virtual march”) demonstrate a community’s growing power — or is it “busy work” for supporters who haven’t been asked to do anything in a while?\nHow this relates to online activism: Too many nonprofits, unfortunately, seem to engage in token actions that don’t move things forward as part of an overall strategy. And even when a given action is a part of a strategy, nonprofits are often vague about communicating that to supporters. Exactly how will calling this legislator advance a critical piece of legislation? Is there a chance the bill will actually pass? If not, there could be other legitimate strategy to build public support for it — things are long-term, remember? — but organizations must be clear to supporters that “victory” in this case won’t be a new law, but, for instance, 10 vocal new supporters in Congress.\nBeing accountable to a real-world communityCommunity organizers are often derided as rabble-rousers, troublemakers, or professional activists who dupe people into following them. But true community organizing isn’t about swooping in and ginning up outrage by telling the locals to fight the man. It’s generally approached as much more Freirian — taking direction from and being accountable to the local community. Organizers bring their experience of tactics and strategy, and may serve to inspire people that they do have the power to make change. But the causes around which communities organize should come from the community itself.\nHow this relates to online activism: Technology is too often seen as a strategy in and of itself. But the Internet and social media — like fax machines, phone trees and the printing press before them — are simply tools, able to be used tactically to great effect, but only when part of a larger strategy. Focusing on the tech divorces a campaign from its community, and leaves the online organizer in the role of the “expert” — “I’ll show you how to use Twitter to clean up your city!” — leaving little room for a community to actually control the direction of a campaign.\nRemembering that the community’s long-term strategy is paramount — and being willing to listen, discern and collaborate with that community — will help keep the people whose lives and livelihoods are on the line actually in charge.\nGo where the people areSocial change happens in communal spaces — not always public, but nearly always intimate to the community as it exists. Workers’ homes and pubs in the labor movement, black churches in the US civil rights movement, gay bars in the gay rights movement, and college campuses in numerous student movements attest to this fact.\nHow this relates to online activism: Rarely will it be effective to create a private “walled garden” social network that you have to convince people to join and become active on. Different communities are on different social networks online — and it’s important to know where your constituencies are — on Facebook, MySpace, Twitter or somewhere else. The places where a community is most active socially are most likely to be the places where it’s most effective to organize. If you’re organizing in a sensitive environment, you may have to establish some level of privacy around your campaign, but only after you’ve already engaged people where they are.\nCultivating sustainable leadershipThis is an area to which traditional community organizing aspires, but doesn’t always succeed. The temptation for a “charismatic leader” to emerge and indefinitely control the direction of a social change campaign can be strong. Participants may initially be relieved that they don’t have to “take the heat” when things get tough, and can look to their leader for direction.\nYet time and again we’ve seen movements collapse when the leader — having captured power within the movement or had it thrust upon him or her — burns out or becomes unable to continue. Increasingly in the past half-century, social movements have attempted to make their approaches more sustainable by cultivating leadership, bringing people from the margins into the center and mentoring and encouraging emerging leaders.\nHow this relates to online activism: Seek to put yourself out of a job. The best online campaigns are the ones that are self-sustaining. Encourage those who are taking the most action to begin to brainstorm new ideas and actions for the campaign. Reward people who are doing the most recruiting, and make them feel that they’re a part of the “core” of the organizing. For nonprofits — and I know this will be hard to hear — stop pretending that you’re the only organization active on the issue. Support your members who become active in allied groups and consider working in coalitions early and often. Not only will this cement your supporters’ dedication to the cause, it will build the identity of a long-term movement, rather than a limited “card-carrying member” view of participation.\nHelp continue this conversationBelow, I’ve embedded the slides of our presentation, which goes beyond the things I’ve discussed above and includes an exciting interactive workshop component — so if you’re at NTC, please do stop by!\nI welcome any thoughts, comments or ideas.

Scott Gration sat down with representatives from Save Darfur and the student network STAND for an unprecedented live Q\u0026amp;A, webcast directly from the White House website.\nThe event served as the launch of an initiative the White House is calling Ask U.S., “an effort to reach out to the advocacy communities and to solicit questions on the U.S. Sudan policy from activists deeply and passionately engaged” around Sudan.\nWatch a recording of the webcast.\nSave Darfur Coalition Executive Director Jerry Fowler and STAND Student Director Layla Amjadi were joined by Samantha Power — now the National Security Council’s Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs, but known more widely as the author of “A Problem from Hell”: America and the Age of Genocide, a history of the United States’ response to mass atrocities from Armenia to Rwanda. Power herself was an inspiration for many of the anti-genocide organizations which exist today, including the two that participated in this online exchange.\nFull disclosure: I was a co-founder of the Genocide Intervention Network, STAND’s parent organization, and worked there until 2008.\nCalling for transparency, pushing for accountabilityThe webcast was notable not just for its interactivity — members of both STAND and Save Darfur were encouraged to submit questions, which were then asked directly of Gration on air — but for its accountability.\nSome anti-genocide activists have been critical of the Obama administration for positioning Darfur and Sudan as a prominent human rights issue during the campaign, but taking little action since the election. Here was a chance for anti-genocide activists to put the White House’s point person on Sudan on the spot and demand answers.\nThe responses from Gration — Power, other than introducing and concluding the event, largely remained silent — were generally panned by activists watching the chat via Twitter and Facebook. “In his opening remarks Gration said ‘we owe you answers’ — you still do,” said Will Fischer. “I respect the hell out of Sam Power but I’m not going to buy Gration’s vague answers just because she’s sitting there,” said Genocide Intervention Network Director of Membership Janessa Goldbeck.\nBec Hamilton, who is writing a book about the advocacy movement around Sudan and has worked with the Genocide Intervention Network, reported that the questions for Gration had to be submitted ahead of time, so it’s a little surprising his answers weren’t more sure-footed. Hamilton said a former official at the State Department had seen the event as a way to “manage” the “noise” of activists, but:\nAs it turned out, the shoe was on the other foot. Activists were given the opportunity to ask follow-up questions, and they pursued that avenue with such vigor that any fear of them being co-opted by their well-publicized access to the White House ceased to be a concern. What was a concern was the administration’s inability to provide concrete answers to the advocates’ questions.\nIf the White House was hoping the webcast would placate activists who had been critical of US policy on Sudan, it seemed to do just the opposite. Goldbeck, responding to Gration’s statement that “we know we are going to be held accountable by you,” tweeted “Yes you will,” a message widely reposted by others.\nEmily Diamond-Falk, a spokesperson for the Save Darfur Coalition, was more amiable about the exchange with the White House. “As much transparency as they can give us, they will do, without compromising their policy,” she told me. “He wasn’t able to disclose as much information as we asked, which is going to happen in these sorts of things. … It’s a very delicate line, so engaging policy behind the scenes will still be necessary.”\nMaking the online Q\u0026amp;A possibleAndrea Clarke, director of communications for the Save Darfur Coalition, pitched the idea of a “live online town hall” to Gration’s communications director in August. “We thought it would be something beneficial for activists to be directly engaged around the [Sudan] policy,” Clarke said.\nAfter suggesting the idea of an online town hall to Gration, the special envoy suggested the student organization STAND be a part of the conversation as well. “The special envoy’s office was very committed to answering as many questions as possible, and the involvement of STAND was key to that process,” Clarke said. “It made for a greater diversity of questions, and we feel the activist community was very well represented.”\nGration’s travel itinerary made scheduling difficult, and in the end it occurred without much advance notice. Clarke said Save Darfur received at least 500 questions from activists for the special envoy, and “I think if we have more lead time we’ll have even more questions.”\nAs Micah Sifry wrote on Monday, the willingness of the State Department and White House to engage openly and publicly with advocates who are often critical seems unprecedented. Given the negative response to Gration’s responses, might this kind of transparency be short-lived?\nClarke said she had “no reason to believe there won’t be” similar events in the future as part of the “Ask U.S.” program. Gration “appears to be working very hard to get feedback,” she said. Gration himself wrote that the State Department is “eager to continue an active and robust dialogue with the advocacy community.”\nLayla Amjadi of STAND lamented the lack of specificity in Gration’s answers, telling the Voice of America that activists “were really frustrated by how vague the policy review was on benchmarks and pressures and incentives.” She called for an approach involving bigger players than Gration alone — “Obama, Biden and Clinton” — and declared:\nNow that we know that we’ve got their ear, let’s talk to them. They’re looking for us to hold them accountable. So let’s do it.\n“There are certainly questions that activists who are voices for those who cannot necessarily be heard right now have, and it’s important that those questions are answered by the administration,” said Diamond-Falk. “The fact that [Gration] engaged the Save Darfur Coalition and the student movement … proves that activists have to have a voice on this issue and in this administration.”\nThe future of high-level advocacy?“We certainly hope that this can be one tactic that other advocacy groups can use to demand accountability of the administration,” Clarke said. “I hope this is something that’s taken on board by communications departments of other advocacy groups.”\nMost organizations may not have the political pressure necessary to convince public officials to host a live, online questioning. The broad constituency that has been active around Darfur and Southern Sudan for the past five years was a definite advantage to making the webcast happen, Clarke said, as was President Obama’s stated support on the campaign trail for resolving the crises in Sudan.\nGration’s willingness to engage activists on the issue, however, may have been the most critical element — it’s hard to imagine a live Q\u0026amp;A happening without a public official’s support. “Gration appears to be working very hard to get feedback,” Clarke said.\nEngaging more than one organization made the proposal more attractive to public officials. Save Darfur asked for the event, and the special envoy’s office suggested a representative of student activists join as well. Gration’s office wanted the event to be seen as legitimately representing the entire Sudan advocacy movement, not simply a single pressure group.\nCautious criticism seemed to have paid off in helping make the dialogue possible. Many Sudan advocacy organizations including STAND and Save Darfur have been publicly supportive of the special envoy, while continuing to push for more transparency and specifics. Gration had been criticized by some activists as “naive” with some going so far as demanding his resignation, but responses from Save Darfur and STAND’s parent organization, the Genocide Intervention Network, had largely not suggested that level of displeasure. “I think that we don’t always agree with the special envoy’s office, but we maintain an open line of communication, and that has helped us a lot,” Clarke said.\nAs for the issue of Sudan, could pressure on legislators coupled with Gration’s limited responses provoke more Congressional action? The online event with Gration directly followed a conference for anti-genocide activists, including a full day of meetings with members of Congress. Diamond-Falk pointed out that following the student lobbying and live webchat, 44 members of Congress signed a letter to President Obama ahead of his visit to China, a major trading partner of Sudan’s, urging the president to make Sudan a priority in his discussions there.\nClarke said if a second online Q\u0026amp;A occurs, Save Darfur “will be pushing for questions that are extremely direct from those who are suffering on the ground,” suggesting the event can not only be a chance to connect activists to the administration, but survivors of the genocide and wars in Sudan as well.\nUpdate: Bec Hamilton reported that a former State Department official had called Sudan activists “noise we had to manage,” and I mistakenly attributed it to current State Department officials; it’s been corrected in the text above.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/government-accountability-through-web-20-case-study/","section":"blog","tags":["activism","communications","Facebook","Twitter"],"title":"Government accountability through web 2.0: A case study"},{"body":"This morning, the fundraising application Causes quietly shut down their presence on MySpace. In their email to administrators of Causes on MySpace, they wrote:\nThank you for the work you’ve done on Causes on MySpace. Due to the lack of activity on MySpace, we’ve decided to focus our efforts on the Causes application on Facebook. On Friday at noon EDT, we will be removing all causes from MySpace. In the meantime, you can post a link to a cause on Facebook (or create one at http://apps.facebook.com/causes) asking your members to change over. We appreciate the work you’ve put into your cause community on MySpace and we hope that the broader functionality available on the Causes application on Facebook will offer you even more opportunities to raise awareness, advocate for change and fundraise for your nonprofit. If you have questions, please email support@causes.com.\nAt that exact moment, Causes on MySpace had 184,674 current users. That’s 184,674 individual people (minus a few nonprofit staffers) who had taken the time to install an application on MySpace specifically so they could show their support for a nonprofit charity or advocacy group on the social network.\nAs of today, those nonprofit badges have been removed from each of those 184,674 profiles, with no notice to those supporters as to why their Causes badges have disappeared. (The application’s page on MySpace is still up, with no notification that it’s being shut down; new users who try to add it get a message saying it’s “temporarily unavailable.”)\nNo notice has been posted to the Causes blog; Susan Gordon, the Senior Nonprofit Coordinator of Causes, said in an email to me, “We didn’t put the announcement on the blog before because the number of people using the MySpace app is so small.”\nWhy Causes on MySpace failed: Lack of engagementIt’s not clear from either email when Causes decided to shut down the MySpace side of its operation, or why it chose to do so within just a few days. Causes began on Facebook and has always had more users on there (currently 35.2 million). From Causes’ point of view, MySpace was probably more trouble than it was worth given the percentage of their total users, though I wouldn’t call nearly 200,000 people a “small” number.\nCauses on Facebook had, from the beginning, more to offer nonprofits than its MySpace version. Nonprofits could, for instance, send email messages to all their Causes supporters on Facebook — something not possible using Fan Pages or Facebook Groups over 2,000 people. On MySpace, probably due to the limitations of the network itself, there was no such functionality.\nIn fact, in one of my first write-ups on using social networks for fundraising and advocacy, I highlighted Causes not as a great way to fundraise but as a great way to engage members. There was less chance for engagement on MySpace; though supporters could still put up a badge demonstrating their support and make donations, in my experience those were actually the least useful parts of Causes.\nAgain, I suspect this was a limitation imposed by MySpace, so I don’t necessarily fault Causes. The lesson here, though, is that a fundraising widget is not enough of a draw. The chance for engaging supporters — not just in things like one-way email blasts but in things like leaderboards showing the top fundraisers among supporter-created Causes — is, in the end, the “killer” part of this app.\nWhat this means for nonprofits on MySpaceDespite repeated claims that MySpace is “dead,” I continue to think it’s a smart move for many nonprofits to have a presence there.\nSociologist danah boyd has documented the clear socioeconomic differences between MySpace and Facebook, and Amy Sample Ward has stressed the need to know your community and where it is. Facebook, after all, was built by and for middle- and owning-class college-educated folks — exactly those people who fill nonprofit staffs. But if your organization serves a different community, then simply going where your staff is familiar might not be the best choice.\nFor those who want to do peer-to-peer fundraising on MySpace, there are still widgets like ChipIn available for that purpose. They won’t have the “built-in” feel that Causes on MySpace did, but they’re fairly easy to guide people through with a quick training or video.\nWhat this means for nonprofit fundraising on social networksThe bigger lesson here is that you can’t rely on third-party, often for-profit services to support your organization’s interests. To Causes, leaving MySpace to focus on its core community on Facebook made good business sense, but certainly those organizations left in the lurch on MySpace feel otherwise.\nI think Rebecca Leaman said it best — don’t put “all fundraising eggs in one third-party basket!” These services are useful, and can help your organization advance its mission, but it’s not accountable to you — and you need to have other options.\nLetting go of your message, holding on to your relationshipsI (and many others) have often said that in order to be successful in social media, nonprofits need to be willing to give up some control over their message — to let supporters speak in their own voice. What Causes’ move has exposed, though, is that while it’s important to let go of your message, you still need to have control over your relationships.\nNonprofits don’t own or even control the connections they have with their supporters in these spaces — the comments, messages, badges and memberships of supporters within social networks are all locked within those social networks and are used under contract (terms of service) from the social network.\nSystems like Facebook Connect or OpenSocial allow those relationships to be exposed elsewhere, but that’s not the same as control. If the social network or service decides the nonprofit has run afoul of the contract, or the company goes bankrupt, cancels services or features, or gets sold to a different company who does — there’s nothing an organization will be able to do.\nThat’s why it’s important to have multiple channels of communication with supporters and to continually try to move people toward the center of your organization by deepening involvement, so that if you lose them in one space they don’t simply fade off into the ether.\nOpen-source, open data, open networksAmy Sample Ward makes some great points that social change communities may have to take the lead on technology by pushing for more openness and transparency. I’ve written before, for instance, that community blogs run better on open-source software, and I think in principle the same is true for social networks.\nBut nonprofits and social change movements will always have to go where the supporters are — and in many cases that will mean closed, proprietary, walled-garden social networks.\nWhat would it look like if nonprofits and social change movements — which these third party applications often use to market themselves as effective and “good” — started demanding some openness?\nIs it reasonable to assert that organizations and individuals should “own” their relationships, even when within a proprietary network? Can long-term social change happen when connections must be re-built on each new online social network to be developed?\nWhile Causes on MySpace may be no more, I think this event raises some important questions for the relationship between nonprofits, social change, and for-profit software and services. What are your thoughts?\nUpdate: I hadn’t seen Read Write Web’s coverage of this, but I think it’s worth a read. As I say above, I think Causes’ supposed “failures” to raise tons of money for nonprofits is less of an issue than some might think (for a great perspective on this, see Allison Fine). But as many of the commenters suggest, the way forward is to explore mechanisms for open-sourcing our relationships from these closed, proprietary systems, be they widgets like Causes or networks like Facebook and MySpace.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/11/causes-abandons-184-674-nonprofit-supporters-myspace/","section":"blog","tags":["community","MySpace"],"title":"Causes abandons 184,674 nonprofit supporters on MySpace"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/tags/myspace/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"MySpace"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/categories/open-source/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"open source"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/10/","section":"month","tags":null,"title":"Archives: October 2009"},{"body":" Today at the Peace and Justice Studies Association 2009 Conference at Marquette University, I hosted a workshop called, \u0026ldquo;Finding the Movement\u0026rsquo;s Voice: Online Social Networks and Social Change\u0026rdquo;:\nThe subtitle of this workshop could be, \u0026ldquo;Social change has always relied on social networks — they just weren\u0026rsquo;t called Facebook.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m going to be talking concretely about the strategy of using online tools for social change.

But folks involved in social change — online or offline — can’t stay there. We have to be willing to step up and do the difficult organizing work that leverages our knowledge and experts’ data into something larger: a movement.\nEverybody Organizing EverybodyCommunity organizers are a natural fit for “web 2.0” — the movement from one-way broadcasting on the web to two-way coversation and connection. I want to expand the definition a little bit, however, and suggest that online organizing goes far beyond the professional, experienced organizers.\nOne of the defining aspects of web 2.0 is social organization. People are constantly presented with their social circles in visual media: Facebook news feeds, MySpace top friends, Twitter updates, etc. In short, more people can see their network, in a much more literal way. This is especially true for young adults (currently Millennials) who might have social networks scattered across wide geographic areas and are less firmly rooted to a specific place through vocational, familial or other commitments.\nCommunities at the margins of society have always had a more visceral understanding of their social networks, which are often the sites of social change planning and strategizing — consider the role of black churches in the US civil rights movement, or gay bars and bathhouses in the early Stonewall era of the gay rights movement. So I don’t want to suggest that this phenomenon of a community visualized is necessarily new for everyone, but I think it is new for many folks in the mainstream of society.\nThe online “social web” — social networks and social media — allows people to organize their social connections, not simply to put them in order, but to connect and collaborate with others. Evite invitations and Facebook events are clear examples of this, as is Wikipedia.\nIncreasingly, the social web is teaching everyday folks how to be community organizers.\nIt’s usually gurus, however, who get — or take — the credit for this transformation. On the contrary, I see it as a much more grassroots bubbling-up of organizing skills. Everyone has the ability to organize and inspire others; the current tools are simply making those skills more visible.\nFewer Leaders, More Leadership“Organizations and societies,” wrote Bruce Kokopeli and George Lakey, “do need leadership, but they do not need leaders.”1 They argued for a shared value of leadership, in which many individuals took responsibility for the direction of a group, but didn’t invest the institutional power in a single person to call the shots. A critical part of this feminist approach relies on cultivating leadership among more and more individuals. Everyone has a stake, and everyone has a say.\nWhile there are particular challenges putting that theory into practice in an organization, the good news is that movements, particularly those engaging in online social change, are particularly positioned to take advantage of this approach.\nThe fact that more people are organizers, and that everyone can exercise leadership, does not mean that there is no role for the full-time organizer. Indeed, the “professional” organizer becomes more important than ever, passing on stories and lived experience, and sharing a pedagogy for cultivating new leadership. What fades away is the positioning of some people within a movement as “experts” to whom everyone looks for direction.\nPaulo Freire calls such an approach “co-intentional education,” in which each person is both teacher and student. Those with more experience may seek to inspire or ask questions to further dialogue, but as a way to further develop strategy rather than dictate to or control the masses.\nAttempting to liberate the oppressed without their reflective participation in the act of liberation is to treat them as objects which must be saved from a burning building; it is to lead them into the populist pitfall and transform them into masses which can be manipulated. … [T]he oppressed must see themselves as women and men engaged in the … vocation of becoming more fully human.2\nThis may seem like heavy or strident language in the context of online petition drives or peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns. But my goal is to push social change organizers to look toward the larger picture. What sort of movement do you want to build in the long-term? What role do people play in that movement — is it a passive one of letter-signing and donation-giving, or an active one of working from the ground up for lasting change?\nSelling, Giving and CultivatingWant to support online organizing? Help promote a panel at SXSW 2010: Vote for us by the end of Friday!\nIvan Boothe is part of a proposed panel for the South by Southwest Interactive conference, “Connecting Communities for the Common Good: Owning Online Organizing,” along with Ben Rattray, founder of change.org; Peter Corbet with iStrategy Labs; Sally Kohn of the Center for Community Change; and moderated by Kari Dunn Saratovsky from the Case Foundation.\nWe need your help to get this panel on the schedule! Please consider voting for the panel at SXSW (quick registration required). Additionally, please leave a comment on the panel’s page. Voting accounts for only about 30% of the decision to include a panel, so we want to demonstrate support for discussion around online organizing with your comments.\nIf you’re not familiar with the process, here’s a step-by-step guide to voting from the Case Foundation. There’s no limit to the number of panels you can vote for, so check out Beth Kanter’s list of nptech panel proposals and share the love!\nSocial marketing experts are adept at building brand loyalty, or encouraging the formation of an identity around an issue. They know how to sell the idea of “social good” to the public at large, using people’s goodwill toward a cause as a way to market to them through a given company, and increase donations to a partner charity. Well-known examples of this are the RED campaign and Starbucks’ Ethos Water.\nOnline organizers turn a skeptical eye toward “social good” and social marketing. It doesn’t mean such projects aren’t worth exploring or learning from, and it doesn’t mean that everyone involved is a charlatan simply out to make a buck. But selling people an identity, even a “good” one, is fundamentally different from organizing for social change. Freire again: “Conviction cannot be packaged and sold; it is reached, rather, by means of a totality of reflection and action.3\nMovement building also goes beyond electoral organizing. Folks working for social change often form common cause with those organizing around a political candidate, and there is of course much to be learned and shared between the two practices. But whereas elections are centered around a single charismatic leader, a fully-engaged, vibrant social change movement consists of both shared vision and shared leadership. Elections give people an answer, while movements ask people a question — and then encourage them to speak for themselves.\nInstead of selling or giving supporters a solution, then, online organizers are involved in cultivation. There are pieces of both social marketing and electoral organizing present in online organizing, of course, and experts in these fields can be a useful source of data, but we should be wary of replicating these other models when it comes to leadership.\nNetwork WisdomThere is a developing praxis being explored by numerous thinkers and strategists in online organizing. For sociological analyses — stories and experiences — danah boyd is indispensible. Clay Shirky, Allison Fine, Valdis Krebs and Howard Rheingold explore the power of networks of individuals, while Beth Kanter, DigiActive and Debra Askanase provide concrete case studies of online organizing in action.\nWhat’s your experience? Who are online organizers with whom you share successes and strategies? Please offer your wisdom in the comments!\nLike the idea of discussing and strategizing about online organizing? Please vote for — and even more importantly, leave a positive comment on — the online organizing panel proposal for SXSW. The deadline is the end of the day this Friday, Sept. 4, so don’t delay!

As if the phrase has lost its meaning somehow. Or a bubble had been burst. I know I\u0026rsquo;ve been feeling the same way. Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ve been feeling it too \u0026ndash; or come across others with a similar vibe?\nJoe runs through some great responses from a whole bevy of social-media-for-change folks, including me.\nOne of the comments on Joe\u0026rsquo;s blog post was from Texans Against Hunger. Here\u0026rsquo;s what the author said:\nFunny, I clicked on this post from Twitter expecting a realistic conversation about the limitations of social media tools. Instead, it appears everyone took your question about being jaded to mean \u0026ldquo;How can I get un-jaded,\u0026rdquo; and not, \u0026ldquo;Should I be jaded?\u0026rdquo;\nThe assumption of most twitters above seems to be that these tools work because they\u0026rsquo;re cool OR they\u0026rsquo;ve built a career around them, so if you\u0026rsquo;re feeling jaded due to lack of results or encouraging metrics, get over it and get back to your (disappointing) work.\nIMO, social media tools are pretty poor at changing anything that takes more than one or two mouse-clicks. Sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s all you need \u0026ndash; making a donation, sending petitions, affecting website ratings, flooding online polls, etc.\nMost change, unfortunately, doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen at the end of a mouse-click. But in the long run, these tools also do a good job of hoovering up potential participants for offline actions that will make a difference.\nPerhaps our jadedness comes from a disconnect between the revolutionary nature of the tool, and its less-than-mindblowing uses? If that\u0026rsquo;s the case we\u0026rsquo;ll be managing our own expectations, given enough time.\nI thought the author made some good points that \u0026ldquo;social change techies\u0026rdquo; would do well to keep in mind. I can see how the author might have gotten the impression that some or all of the folks in Joe\u0026rsquo;s roundup are simply shiny-tech pushers. I won\u0026rsquo;t try to speak for them, but I do think they aren\u0026rsquo;t blindly following the latest tech hype and hoping it will change the world — many of them have clear social change strategies.\nMy own background is rooted in a) on-the-ground community organizing, including 100+ hours of training and many times that in actual organizing, and b) academic study of how nonviolent social change can be successful (my degree is in peace and conflict studies). I know \u0026ldquo;social change\u0026rdquo; can be kind of a squishy term (and even more so the strategy-free \u0026ldquo;social good,\u0026rdquo; which Katrin Verclas has amply discussed), so I want to position myself as specifically interested in fundamental social change, at the political, social, economic and cultural levels. I don\u0026rsquo;t see the challenges as being easily fixed, or short-term, or things that can be addressed with a few pieces of legislation or a few institutional reforms.\nWith that in mind, I think social media and social networking hasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely matured as part of long-term social change. Where it has been getting integrated into social justice organizing, it\u0026rsquo;s largely been outside the United States, in places like Colombia and Egypt. And even there, while we can see important strategic concessions, not enough time has really passed to see the extent to which social media helped advance social justice campaigns.\nI entirely share the author\u0026rsquo;s frustration with \u0026ldquo;tech for social change\u0026rdquo; discussions that fawn over the technology and don\u0026rsquo;t engage on the level of strategic change. I saw this happening in particular during the Moldovan \u0026ldquo;Twitter revolution\u0026rdquo; discussion (which Joe linked to in his post). This \u0026ldquo;revolution\u0026rdquo; seemed to captivate a lot of armchair activists on Twitter, mostly because it involved Twitter. They seemed to miss the fact that a) Twitter wasn\u0026rsquo;t actually a big part of the organizing strategy, and b) the campaign itself didn\u0026rsquo;t end up seriously threatening the regime; at best it was a mild skirmish and it certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t a \u0026ldquo;revolution\u0026rdquo; of any kind. (Which is not to diminish the hard work of social justice organizers in Moldova. Mad props to them.)\nThe author\u0026rsquo;s point about social media providing an outlet for people\u0026rsquo;s activism that sucks away people\u0026rsquo;s time for real social change is an excellent one. (A similar dynamic happens every two to four years in the US, when community organizers see their ranks cannibalized by electoral organizing.) Charles Lenchner has written brilliantly about this, using the principle \u0026ldquo;mission over membership.\u0026rdquo;\nToo many nonprofits orchestrate \u0026ldquo;petition drives\u0026rdquo; that aren\u0026rsquo;t about advocating for anything other than larger membership rolls. Too many groups ask constituents to make calls to an elected official without even feigning an attempt at explaining how those calls will help achieve a goal or contribute to a longer-term campaign. The author is absolutely right that too many nonprofits have no social change theory at all; indeed they\u0026rsquo;re more interested in self-perpetuation than winning (often referred to as the nonprofit industrial complex). And when those groups get their hands on social media, they do incredibly un-strategic things with them.\nThe fact that social media can be used unstrategically, however, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it has to be. To pull a line from my earlier post on Twitter, political pamphlets, phone trees and jam-the-faxes must have seemed like strategies in and of themselves when each technology first came out. But smart social justice organizers recognized them as tactics, and such tactics were only effective when deployed as part of an overall strategy for social change.\nSocial media doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you do less organizing — it means you (can) do it better, or at least differently. You still have to use all the old skills of coalition-building, strategic planning, creative social action, managing relationships and preventing burnout. None of that goes away just because you\u0026rsquo;re engaging with people on Facebook instead of in town halls.\nSo to get \u0026lsquo;round to the original question — the reason I don\u0026rsquo;t feel jaded when I look at all the unstrategic uses of social media is because I\u0026rsquo;m focused on the end goal, the social change. Social justice organizers are a pretty creative bunch. Throughout history, they\u0026rsquo;ve taken a wide variety of technologies and used them strategically to move their campaigns forward. I have no doubt social media has and will become one tool in many organizers\u0026rsquo; toolbelts.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/05/social-change-takes-more-than-social-media/","section":"blog","tags":["social change"],"title":"Social change takes more than social media"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/04/","section":"month","tags":null,"title":"Archives: April 2009"},{"body":"In the past two days, posts began popping up on Twitter with the tag \u0026ldquo;#pman” — short for Piata Marii Adunari Nationale, the largest city square in the capital of Moldova. Students were organizing:\nEver since yesterday’s announcement that Moldova’s communists have won enough votes to form a government in Sunday’s elections, Moldova’s progressive youth took to the streets in angry protests. As behooves any political protest by young people today, they also turned to Facebook and Twitter to raise awareness about the planned protests and flashmobs.\nWriters like Evgeny Morozov, above, initially characterized this as a “Twitter revolution,” modeled in the real-time use of Twitter seen during the G20 protests, election monitoring and crowd-sourcing the location of a certain torch when it was passing through San Francisco. (Thus a little different than the traditional nonprofit use of Twitter.)\nIt’s certainly exciting to see technology being used in ways that amplify and extend the impact of movement organizing. I think it’s easy, however, to misread the technology as the cause of the movement rather than as simply a tool of it.\nFire, for instance, was a society-changing tool. Its revolutionary potential, however — cooking food and thus making it more digestible, nutritious, and lasting — was only realized through its strategic use.\nSome people, awed by the fire, seem to confuse it with the food. This is represented most clearly by Jon Pincus, who writes:\nTwitter is a strategy.\nHe cites a number of campaigns that have used Twitter in successful ways as evidence of this claim. To me, though, this simply shows that Twitter can be an effective tool for a given strategy — but that’s not automatically the case.\nConsider this: Why did organizers execute a given campaign on Twitter and not, say, Identi.ca, FriendFeed, Jaiku or Ping.fm (similar microblogging services) — or, for that matter, through Facebook statuses or MySpace bulletins?\nThere’s a tendency to collapse the strategy and the tool — to attempt to feast on the fire itself. To say, “This is what we want to accomplish, and, hey! there’s a tool that does that!” — and then equate the tool with the strategy. But they’re still separate thought processes and separate stages in developing a campaign.\nIt appears that Twitter was a good tool to use in the cases Jon cited and I mentioned above. But if organizers limit themselves to seeing Twitter as a strategy in and of itself — without considering the strategy apart from the tool — they risk overlooking ways to run a more effective campaign on other platforms, or augmenting a campaign using multiple platforms.\nWorse, organizers risk giving supporters feel-good activism that quenches their desire for social change without actually moving the movement closer to a concrete goal, or putting any pressure on powerholders.\nThe strategy always comes first, and then you figure out which tool fits. The alternative? A forest fire.\nPolitical pamphlets, phone trees and jam-the-faxes must have seemed like strategies in and of themselves when each technology first came out. But a campaign that didn’t begin with a strategy to deploy those tools in an effective way wouldn’t have been successful.\nThe “real-time coverage” use of Twitter, in the style of TXTMob, can be effective, and can even form part of the organization of a protest, as it did in the case of the Olympic torch. But that’s not a strategy or even a revolution — it’s simply street-level news. And in the case of Moldova, the organizing was happening elsewhere:\nIn fact Twitter did not play that big role. The story is quite simple — young and active bloggers decided to have a flash-mob action, lighting candles and ‘mourning Moldova’ because of Communists victory, which nobody recognized due to the multiple violations before and during the campaign. They agreed on the time and place of the action through the network of Moldovan blogs (blogs aggregator blogosfera.md), and social networks like Facebook/Odnoklassniki, etc.\nIn other words, the most effective tools to execute the strategy in question — organizing opposition to the regime and making it visible to other Moldovans — didn’t include Twitter.\nIn Evgeny Morozov’s analysis of Twitter in Moldova, he says:\nIt’s really good that the Moldovan students didn’t organize this revolution via Friendster or LiveJournal (which is still a platform for choice for many users in Eastern Europe). If they did, they would never have gotten as much attention from the rest of the world.\nThis perspective is an example of collapsing the strategy and the tool. More specifically: Getting attention from the rest of the world is not automatically the objective of any given social change movement.\nMost social change organizers know this. There are moments when you want to focus on building awareness and/or getting media attention, but that’s often not the primary focus of the campaign. In the case of the Moldovan students, it could be that what was most needed was a way to get organizers to identify and strategize with one another — in which case Twitter would have been a very poor (or at least fantastically blunt) tool.\nSuch perspective is possible only if you think of Twitter as one possible tool, perfect for use in some strategies and rather ineffective in others. A near-religious belief in Twitter (or any technology) as a strategy leads to a narrowing of the actual strategy — getting the world to pay attention becomes the goal, because, hey, that’s what Twitter can be effective at doing!\nIn this case, organizers might have gotten attention from beyond Moldova with a few dozen Twitterers, but failed at their primary goal of making opposition to the regime visible to other Moldovans.\nAs Alan Rosenblatt writes, different technologies have different ideologies, and tools that are more “inherently democratic” like Twitter can be used as tools within a strategy that empowers people to a much larger degree than one-way media like television. That doesn’t negate the fact that the strategy — the reason for the campaign itself — must be laid out first.\nBegin with your campaign’s strategy — the food you want to eat. Then determine which technologies will best cultivate the fire within your supporters to achieve the social change you seek.\nUpdate: I misattributed something to Jon Pincus that was actually written by Evgeny Morozov. It’s fixed, above.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/04/fire-food-why-theres-no-such-thing-twitter-revolution/","section":"blog","tags":["Twitter","social change"],"title":"The fire and the food: Why there's no such thing as a Twitter revolution"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/02/","section":"month","tags":null,"title":"Archives: February 2009"},{"body":" Image credit Flickr user avlxyz Just a quick note to say I’ll be speaking as part of Social Actions’ free “Using Facebook for Social Change” webinar on Thursday, along with Susan Gordon, the nonprofit coordinator of Causes, and moderated by Beth Pickard and David Karp of Firstgiving.\nYou’re invited to join in a live and open text chat to discuss how you can use Facebook for social change.

In one fell swoop, hundreds of political activists’ online communities were gone, despite the fact that they had been paying for the service.\nWhy did one system failure take down such a large network? Because the entire project was being run by one person, part-time. These were fairly high-traffic blogs, yet their content was hosted on Soapblox’s own servers, and when it all went down, that data became unavailable. After first proclaiming the software “dead,” developer Paul Preston responded to an outpouring of community support and donations by working to restore the service.\nOn many lists and other community blogs, discussions have centered on whether it makes sense for these blogs to stay on Soapblox. “The consensus that appears to have emerged after a fairly short but very wide-ranging discussion is: it may make sense to transition to another system eventually; for now there is no readily available alternative,” wrote Shai Sachs at MyDD.\nMost of those discussions then devolve into “Drupal! No, WordPress!” with proponents of each sparring over how to construct a community blog similar to Soapblox’s core features. I want to refocus the discussion around the underlying issue: Community blogs simply run better on open-source software, regardless of the platform.\nOf course, it’s true that different systems have different features, and one of the attractions of Soapblox was that it offered just want community-blog sites needed out of the box. Setting up community blogs on Drupal or WordPress, both of which I have pretty extensive experience with, is definitely possible, but each requires customization — something many local activists don’t have time or money to do.\nThere are many companies that offer “hosted” versions of open-source software, in the same way that Soapblox (the company) offered a hosted version of Soapblox (the software). So why would I recommend the open-source hosts?\nThe issue here — and the difference between these open-source hosts and Soapblox — is the gigantic community of open-source developers behind them. Soapblox, like these other companies, helps set up hosting and put a friendly face on a somewhat complicated piece of software. But there are hundreds of people working on Drupal that aren’t in any way connected to Bryght, or Acquia, or May First — and that’s something that all of their customers benefit from: new features, continually-upgraded plugins and security fixes.\nWith a proprietary system, you get only what the company chooses to put out, and only what they have time to put out. Paul has since suggested that “SoapBlox needs to be transformed from a proprietary model to one of open source to help get rid of me alone as the single-point of contact with so much stuff.”\nI think that’s great, and if Soapblox becomes an open-source project then I’d definitely recommend it along with other open-source platforms. But the point isn’t just to make Paul’s life easier, or make him more responsive to customers. Open-sourcing Soapblox would make the software, and the blogs it hosts, better. Don’t believe me? Information Week magazine wrote a cover story about how businesses are using Drupal and other open-source software, and why:\nDrupal draws on a strength that’s common to other successful open source efforts: a vibrant community that drives innovation and lets companies tap the development efforts of thousands of people experimenting with the system.\nSince reviving itself, Soapblox has hired some more people, and that’s nice, I’m sure, for both Paul and his customers. But the model by which we pay more and more people to maintain our vitally-important software in locked cages just seems poor to me.\nEven if Bryght/Acquia/May First went out of business tomorrow, virtually all of its customers could find another vendor to take their system completely intact and get them up and running in an hour or two. Soapblox dies, and their customers are stuck in the dark — if they’re lucky they might be able to get a dump of the database and then painstakingly input it into another system.\nOpen-source communities as the scaffolding for community blogs just seems like a no-brainer to me. I certainly understand the limited time people have and the inertia around a system you already know, but I would hope this might serve as a wake-up call to explore more robust and sustainable systems, be it Drupal or WordPress, Joomla or Plone — or, if Soapblox takes that route, Soapblox itself.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2009/01/community-blogs-run-better-open-source-software/","section":"blog","tags":["community","Drupal","WordPress"],"title":"Community blogs run better on open-source software"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/tags/wordpress/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"WordPress"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/","section":"year","tags":null,"title":"Archives: 2008"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/10/","section":"month","tags":null,"title":"Archives: October 2008"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/tags/flickr/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Flickr"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/tags/livejournal/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"LiveJournal"},{"body":"In 2008, I spoke at the Democracy in Action Community Conference about the Genocide Intervention Network’s use of social networking and social media to achieve our goals in advocacy, fundraising and membership development.\nDownload a PDF of the presentation slides.\nUsing Social Networks for Social Change: Facebook, MySpace and MoreI had planned to present a slideshow along with my talk, but in fact, technical difficulties prevented me from doing so. The presentation posted on Slideshare is thus a recreation of that talk, with the audio keyed to the slides. (Update July 14, 2022: Some years back, Slideshare deleted all audio from presentations. At some point I recovered the audio, but in the intervening time I appear to have lost it again. Apologies!) For those of you who prefer things in textual form, I’ll write out most of it below, but I encourage you to at least page through the slides for the pictures.\nMany of the points I make in the presentation draw on things I’ve written on this site; I’ve linked to some of these articles in the body of the presentation below.\nJump directly to the success stories:\nUsing Online Student Pressure to Pass Legislation A Photo Petition Puts Students at the Heart of a Congressional Briefing How Social Networks Can Coordinate a Fundraising Drive A Mission to EmpowerThe Genocide Intervention Network is an organization that I helped form in college, and where I worked as director of communications and Internet strategy coordinator from 2004–2008. The mission of the organization is to empower members with tools to prevent and stop genocide.\nThe idea of “empowerment” is key to the organization’s mission, and undergirds our approach to social networks and social media. GI-Net wants members who can think for themselves, and consequently social networking is a key method by which the organization helps train supporters to speak for themselves, for us, and for an anti-genocide movement.\nMany groups use social networks for mobilizing — getting members out to an evnt, getting people to sign a petition, getting people to donate for a cause. GI-Net focuses on organizing — creating an educated constituency of people who can motivate others.\nWhen we first arrived on Facebook in 2005, for example, there were already dozens of groups about the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. So it was much more about giving supporters tools to take effective action than it was about convincing people to join our cause. Social networks are an integral part of an organizing strategy, because communication and engagement are what they’re all about.\nWeaving Your Social WebThe dynamics and demographics of each social network are different — what may make sense on MySpace could be seen as annoying on Facebook. If you have a specific niche, you might try focused networks like BlackPlanet, Eons, GLEE, WiserEarth or The Hub (Update, Aug. 18, 2010: The Hub has been retired).\nFor a sociological study of these different kinds of networks, check out the writings of danah boyd. Interestingly, many nonprofit professionals see Facebook as the “more interesting” or “more useful” social network as compared to MySpace, and that’s largely because, indeed, Facebook is designed to appeal to the predominant class and educational backgrounds of these folks. Depending on an organization’s constituency, however, MySpace might actually be a better way to reach your supporters. Don’t decide where to organize online based on which site you or your executive director personally think is most appealing.\nWhen you’re determining which network(s) to organize on, the key thing to remember is that you don’t have to be everywhere. In fact, it’s often better if you start with just one — get your bearings, try out some different approaches, and become thoughtfully engaged with your community of supporters there. You need to make a commitment to each network you join; there’s nothing worse (or more unprofessional looking) than a clearly-abandoned organizational profile, where messages go unanswered and spam comments go unmoderated.\nSocial Media and Social NetworksSocial media (e.g. YouTube and Flickr) often integrate particularly well with social networks (e.g. Facebook and MySpace), as a way to help engage members and heighten interest. Why not simply upload your own images and host your own videos? The “social” in social media ensures that, if you post your media with useful titles, descriptions and keywords, other people may well discover you who wouldn’t otherwise have encountered you — and you’ll draw them further into your social web.\nUsing Videos on MySpaceWhen we first put our profile up on MySpace, we were getting one or two friend requests a day, and that’s not too bad for just starting off. As soon as we put up a short video about the organization — posted via YouTube, in the hopes of drawing in people from that site as well — our friend requests went up to 10–15 per day. Supporters could embed the videos in their own profiles themselves. That’s the advantage of social media in social networks: People are drawn to photos and video, and the nature of social networking allows them to easily share them with friends.\nKeys to Success on Social Networks It’s about member engagement. You might notice there’s only one key: Facilitating conversations between and among your supporters. Ultimately, getting an excited base of supporters begins with having them talk to each other about what they’re doing around an issue.\nIt’s really not a billboard. You need to cultivate relationships with your supporters.\nThe Money ThingSocial networks are not going to replace your development director. Even when you do raise money, it’s usually more about member engagement than it is about a significant revenue stream. GI-Net’s experience with Causes, a platform on Facebook and MySpace, was that “fundraisers” were actually a great way to give supporters something concrete to work toward — but that it hasn’t been a very significant source of donations. Nonetheless, the social aspect to it ensures that members who do participate become even more engaged and are often willing to help spearhead the next advocacy campaign.\nThe top Cause on Facebook had, as of June 2008, more than 3 million members but only raised about $50,000; the vast majority of nonprofits using Causes hadn’t raised more than a few hundred dollars. Innovative fundraising campaigns using social networks may bear fruit financially, but member engagement is almost always going to be the primary goal in the end.\nLet Your People Speak…Causes is also a good illustration of another point: You need to let your supporters speak for you on social networks. GI-Net set up an “official” Cause on Facebook, but a member-created Cause benefiting us has more than twice the number of supporters. We could have tried to shut down the unofficial group in an effort to control our message, but instead we reached out to the creator — who was more than willing to send out alerts anyway — and found ways to engage our supporters while still recognizing their own creativity.\nThe whole point of the social experience is the coveted “recommendation from a friend.” Forcing your members to send out only board-approved talking points won’t inspire much loyalty, and probably won’t be very persuasive to their friends. Nonprofits have to be willing to lose some of their message control in exchange for member loyalty. Trust me — it’s worth the trade-off.\n…And Then Listen to What They SayOn our MySpace profile, we have a prominent newsletter-signup form at the top of the screen. But we don’t simply cut-and-paste our blast emails directly to the MySpace crowd. For one of our MySpace blogs, we said the following:\nAre you active in your community on anti-genocide issues? Raising money for civilian protection in Darfur — educating your neighbors about the mass atrocities in Burma — working to pass divestment from Sudan in your state? Leave us a comment and describe what you’re doing!\nWe want you in our top friends!\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll be rotating in all of our MySpace friends who are active on anti-genocide issues into our top friends. You’ve been supporting us, now we want to support you!\nOn MySpace, putting someone in your “top friends” is a way of showing thanks and respect, and it was an easy thing to do. We heard from a dozen different local activists who were all featured, some of whom ended up being key leaders on future advocacy campaigns. Show your supporters that you’re listening to them, and they’ll reward you!\nThis approach — what’s sometimes called “user-generated content” — is a fantastic way to converse with supporters on social networks. Ask people for their stories, photos, videos or other creative work, and then feature some or all of that content. You’ll end up with more dedicated members who are willing to take the next step; after having been engaged on a small issue (“take a picture of your fundraiser for Darfur”) they’ll be willing to lead on a larger one (“help organize a local visit to your member of Congress”).\nSuccess Story 1: Using Online Student Pressure to Pass LegislationIn 2005, there was an anti-genocide bill that was being held up by a Senate committee chair. Using Facebook, GI-Net identified and reached out to students in that senator’s home state.\nInstead of having the students contact the senator directly, we guided the students in a process of using the website OpenSecrets.org to determine the senator’s top campaign donors. The students called those donors and asked them to contact the senator and say that standing up against genocide is a moral imperative, and that the senator should move the bill.\nThe result: Two weeks later, the bill was passed by the committee, was approved by the full Senate, and eventually was signed into law.\nSuccess Story 2: A Photo Petition Puts Students at the Heart of a Congressional BriefingGI-Net’s student division, STAND, initiated a campaign called “Picture a World Without Genocide,” in which they encouraged high school students to submit photos via Facebook and MySpace of their activism on Darfur. Hundreds of pictures were collected and compiled into a large poster spelling out the word “Darfur.”\nWe presented this poster at a Capitol Hill briefing, in conjunction with a report we were releasing about congressional action on Darfur. We had prepared the report, and originally we were going to do a traditional press conference in which we called out Congress for their inaction.\nWe decided to couple the release of this report with this visible manifestation of student activism, as a way to keep our members engaged. In the weeks following the event, the numbers of co-sponsors for key legislation increased substantially — and because students had been “part of the action,” they were able to claim part of the victory.\nIn fact, even if no new co-sponsors had signed on, the action still would have been a great way to activate supporters, so it was really a no-lose campaign for us.\nA Worldwide Photo Gallery in 24 HoursWhen coordinated rallies focusing on Darfur were set up by the Save Darfur Coalition (of which GI-Net is a part), we encouraged our members to take part — and take pictures. Then we had them upload their images to the photosharing site Flickr, along with a special tag, or keyword, for that event. Using Flickr’s own system, we could then pull images with that tag onto GI-Net’s website in a constantly-updated, rotating gallery of Darfur activism the day after the event.\nTotal time on our part? About 15 minutes to write the email to our members, and 10 minutes to put the gallery on our website.\nSuccess Story 3: How Social Networks Can Coordinate a Fundraising DriveSTAND’s annual “DarfurFast” encourages students on one day to refrain from one luxury item, and donate the proceeds to GI-Net’s Darfur protection program. We engage people around the campaign on several different channels, including Facebook, MySpace, LiveJournal and Twitter.\nSocial networks were a key way to keep supporters engaged — as well as inviting friends on campus to take part in the real-world upcoming events. The key is that the person-to-person networks already existed in the form of chapters and campus networks; online social networks simply facilitated an easier invitation to friends.\nSo, we raised more than $500,000 over the course of three years with this event; 2007 saw participation from 450 high schools and 300 colleges. But it’s very unlikely we would have ever raised that kind of money via Facebook et al. alone — the online social networks simply supplemented the on-the-ground organizing we (and campus leaders) had already been doing. In fact, online social networks are probably most strategically useful when the event is offline, allowing supporters to quickly spread the word well ahead of time.\nIt’s worth mentioning that many of these methods worked particularly well because they centered on students, who are most active on these networks, generally have easy access to computers and are more likely to have free time. While GI-Net has a constituency far beyond students alone (and sometimes reaches those constituencies directly through networks like Eons), you shouldn’t necessarily expect these kinds of returns from everyone. As noted above, working-class communities, communities of color, folks with less formal education and various kinds of “marginalized” groups interact with online social networks very differently, often because of stronger real-world social networks. The best organizing strategy activates people through all their social connections, whether online or offline.\nFinal Thoughts Engaging supporters on social networks is long-term. Don’t expect immediate results. It takes effort. You need to be willing to communicate, in both directions, with your supporters. If you want your members to spread your message, you have to trust them. Feedback in the comments below is welcome!

As I’ve written before, that seems less useful to me than focusing on empowering an effective movement — whether or not people donate to your organization or sign up for your newsletter. This isn’t to minimize the challenges everyone faces on how to support working for social change, both financially and emotionally. But it is to say that movements are bigger than any one nonprofit. Certainly, organizations can ignore that and focus on using MySpace to get new email addresses and Facebook to drum up donations — but frankly, I don’t think that has a lot to do with social change.\nOnly when the operational concerns are placed secondary to social change concerns do I see social change really being possible. It’s not a secondary outcome; it has to be the primary concern. And that’s true, in my opinion, whether you’re talking about online or offline social change.\nMore than thirty years ago, sociologists Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward wrote in the introduction to Poor People’s Movements: Why They Succeed, How They Fail (1977):\n[D]uring those brief moments when lower-class groups exert some force against the state, those who call themselves leaders do not usually escalate the momentum of the people’s protests. They do not because they are preoccupied with trying to build and sustain embryonic formal organizations in the sure conviction that these organizations will enlarge and become powerful.\nMore recently, members of the collective INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence published the scathing The Revolution Will Not Be Funded: Beyond the Non-Profit Industrial Complex, which excoriated the nonprofit system — primarily foundations, but also the kind of institutionalized dissent Piven and Cloward explored above — for perpetuating the social inequity they say they want to end.\nIn the 1970s and ’80s, rising social inequality helped hasten a breakdown of both communities and community struggles. (We “Millennials” of which Fine writes were, of course, originally termed “Reagan Babies.”) Poor people’s movements Piven and Cloward explore were co-opted and defused by top-down organizers from large nonprofits. And family foundations, rooted back in the (first) Gilded Age and gaining power in the tech booms of the 1990s, helped professionalize the practice of dissent. Or as Patrick Reinsborough writes in an oft-quoted essay, “De-Colonizing the Revolutionary Imagination”:\nJust as service oriented NGO’s have been tapped to fill the voids left by the state or the market, so have social change NGO’s arisen to streamline the chaotic business of dissent. Let’s call this trend NGOism, that terrifyingly widespread conceit among professional “campaigners” that social change is a highly specialized profession best left to experienced strategists, negotiators and policy wonks. NGOism is the conceit that paid staff will be enough to save the world.\nSome nonprofits, older and more institutionalized, are wary of giving their members “control” of their “message” in the realm of social networks and social media. Mostly, I think that’s nothing more than a fear of losing power. When you think you know how to change the world, it can be hard for some people to want to involve others — or give anyone else the credit.\nWhat’s interesting is that this time around, there’s a significantly higher ability for activists to self-organize. The message to nonprofits from activists in the past few years seems pretty clear: Stand in our way, and we’ll just go around you.\nThe 2006 student walkouts for immigrant rights spread through MySpace without any “sponsoring” organization. As I explained in a presentation on Facebook, when the Genocide Intervention Network first arrived on the scene, we found dozens of existing groups and networks already active — our objective was simply to connect them and provide them with effective tools for action. A participant in the protests over the Jena Six said, “I am so disappointed with the media right now. I live in Connecticut and I never even heard of this. Honestly if it wasn’t for Facebook, I still wouldn’t know.”\nSo the question really goes to the nonprofits and other groups using social networks and social media:\nWhat kind of social change do you want? Are you willing to help facilitate even if you don’t get credit, coverage, or donations? That doesn’t mean that “big” nonprofits can’t work for social change through technology, or that only unsupported volunteers can really make things better — as Reinsborough puts it in the corollary to the comment above:\nThis is not to say that corporate campaigns and winning concessions is merely “reformist” and therefore not important. The simplistic dichotomy of reform versus revolution often hides the privilege of “radicals” who have the luxury of refusing concessions when it’s not their community or ecosystem that is on the chopping block.\nA more important distinction is which direction is the concession moving towards? Is it a concession that releases pressure on the system and thereby legitimizes illegitimate authority? Or is it a concession that teaches people a lesson about grassroots power building and therefore brings us closer to systemic social change?\nI’m not as worried about whether, as Fine asks, the “tendency to connect only with like-minded people” puts limitations on what can be achieved. Most social change movements, including the US civil rights movement, are grounded in those sorts of communities, what’s referred to as “affective ties.”\nBut there is a larger question of the technology gap — social movements in general might not be as confined by co-optation like Piven and Cloward describe, but poor people’s movements without access or usable knowledge of such technology are still vulnerable to having their goals and struggles appropriated by the more powerful.\nMoreover, as danah boyd explores in her fascinating research, these issues are played out in social networks themselves. “The division around MySpace and Facebook is just another way in which technology is mirroring societal values,” she writes in “Viewing American class divisions through Facebook and MySpace.”\nSo I think there are gaps in access, in knowledge, and in audience — many nonprofits I’ve talked to seem to be more excited about organizing on Facebook for instance, because it seems more “natural” or “easy.” But it may seem that way simply because it aligns with the class and social habits of people who staff nonprofits — and as boyd documents, many subaltern communities of people (for whom nonprofits are often trying to speak) tend to use MySpace to a greater extent.\nTomorrow is Bloggers Unite for Human Rights (Day). The organizers assert that bloggers can “use their space to make the world a better place.” And clearly, given what I do, I think there is a potential for social networks and social media to highlight and organize and empower. But I don’t think we can get too far ahead of ourselves, and I think we need to be clear about just what it is we’re reaching for.\nWorking for social change means being committed to examining inequality and injustice in our world, and it’s simply naïve to think that those dynamics don’t affect the very way our organizations — and our notions of social change — are structured.\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/05/just-what-kind-social-change-are-you-interested/","section":"blog","tags":["social change","Facebook","MySpace"],"title":"Just what kind of social change are you interested in?"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2007/","section":"year","tags":null,"title":"Archives: 2007"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2007/10/","section":"month","tags":null,"title":"Archives: October 2007"},{"body":"Britt Bravo from NetSquared asks, “What is the return on investment of the social web for nonprofits?”\nFor the Genocide Intervention Network, which is the organization I’m involved with that has been most active in social networking, involvement in the “social web” is really an outgrowth of our entire mission: To form the first anti-genocide constituency, and to empower our members with the tools to prevent and stop genocide.\nThe words “constituency” and “empower” are key.\nWe’re not simply looking for a mailing list or an ATM — we want an educated, active movement of people interested in preventing and stopping genocide.\nOur members need to be able to think for themselves on the issue — to hold events in their communities, motivate others to take action, press their elected representatives to take stand — not to simply be another name on a list, but to be a hub in an ever-expanding network.\nThis is really the principle behind the social web: it’s all about conversations. And for us, conversations are the perfect way to build a vibrant, effective movement.\nWhen GI-Net began, we were primary student-oriented, and so organizing in places like Facebook was really a necessity. But as we grew, it became clear that focusing on these types of networks, in which we were able to supply members with knowledge but they were also empowered to speak for themselves, could be a powerful way to grow our impact exponentially.\nIn fact, effective social movements have always been based on affective social ties, and fears of postmodern atomization aside, twenty-first century movements won’t be any different.\nWhen I first started writing about this, however, I explained an important requirement for engagement in the social web to succeed — and this is still true for us today:\nThere’s a mentality shift required to fully engage with social networking and community content sites: sometimes, you have to let go. It’s true that someone could start posting pictures on Flickr of irrelevant things and tag them “antigenocide,” or that some of our biggest fans hosting the YouTube video on MySpace might have profiles that would make some of our donors cringe.\nPerhaps even more significantly, it’s possible that some of the people who encounter us on these sites never make it to our main website, never sign up for a newsletter, never complete an action, and never make a donation.\nFor us, it goes back to our mission: to empower our members to prevent and stop genocide, and in so doing, to create an educated anti-genocide constituency.\nWhile we do, of course, want to increase our membership rolls and make ever-larger donations to civilian protection, in some respects it’s not always necessary for people to perform every anti-genocide action through our organization.\nIf our videos or emails or profiles get people talking more substantially about genocide — and the concrete ways in which they can actually prevent and stop genocide — then in some sense whether they end up on our mailing list is somewhat beside the point. Through their knowledge they will engage others, and ultimately enhance the anti-genocide movement we’re helping to build.\nIn his profile of GI-Net and Catalyst Campaigns, Joshua Levy describes this approach as “similar to bottom-up, open-source collaborative projects,” and I think that’s exactly right. Our organization is engaged in a collaborative project with our members, and while we may have particular resources or acquired expertise, it’s really their activism and passion that will build and drive the movement.\nWhat it all comes down to is that we’re focusing on organizing people into a permanent anti-genocide movement (and much of that happens in a decentralized, self-organized sort of way) rather than simply mobilizing people for a particular event or campaign and then sending them home. If you just need bodies at a rally, names on a petition or donations in your coffers, mobilizing through traditional means will work great. But if you need an active, educated and effective movement, organizing through social webs has the potential to create much more lasting change.\nThe Genocide Intervention Network on the Social Web MySpace Facebook change.org LiveJournal Twitter Flickr YouTube Previous Articles Using Social Networking to Stop Genocide (Idealware), on the origins of GI-Net’s approach Bottom-up social networking interview, on why MySpace isn’t like banner ads (see the second half).

Colin began by offering an example of a participatory-media approach that had backfired for a corporation, the anti-Chevy Chevy Tahoe ad. (This ad campaign would also show up in Marty’s presentation.)\nColin pointed out that Chevy had decided to leave the ads online because they had the effect of driving lots of traffic to the website — thus turning a negative backlash into a positive result. In his presentation, however, Marty said there had been a significant drop in sales of the Tahoe the next quarter — possibly due to the rise in gas prices, but possibly also due to this negative publicity.\nAfter recommending that campaigns engage in participatory media for the simple reason that your users are doing it anyway (giving the example of the “vote different” video), Colin outlined the basic motivations:\nengagement leveraging collective intelligence (Marty might call this being network-centric) publicity because they’re there Colin pointed out that email discussion lists and fora were a basic form of user-generated content. Beyond that lay blogs, then video and photographs, altered images, stories, social networking projects and “ideas” themselves.\nThere are several levels of engagement possible with participatory media:\nobservation (one-way, receiving information) interaction (responding with information, as in a blog comment) contribution (creating information, as in posting a blog) solicitation (asking others to create information in response to yours, as in a video response or a contest) A prime example of participatory media that Colin gave was Late Night with Conan O’Brien’s HornyManatee.com. The site solicits hot manatee action from its users, to great effect.\nMichael then took the helm, demonstrating two participatory media campaigns EchoDitto had worked on (which coincidentally both won awards): Since Sliced Bread and the Pearl Harbor Survivors Project.\nFor the Survivors Project, Michael talked about the strategizing they had done in order to collect the stories of the several-hundred remaining survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. They had set up a toll-free number so that technologically-challenged seniors wouldn’t have to interface with the website, but to their surprise that was the primary mode of submission. In another twist, they established a MySpace profile not expecting much response from a youthful crowd, but soon went on to find 20,000 friend requests.\nMichael pointed out that the nature of participatory media was still new enough that it is able to earn media for the organization — the Survivors Project really took off after a feature in Parade. The very existence of the campaign was a news story, in a way a traditional museum-style exhibit on Pearl Harbor would not be.\nAs for Since Sliced Bread, Michael explained that it was an attempt by SEIU president Andy Stern to solicit ideas directly from workers, because he felt like DC lobbyists and consultants working on labor issues weren’t concerned with the real issues facing his union members.\nUsers were thus invited to submit their best ideas Since Sliced Bread, with the winner receiving a prize of $100,000 and runners-up receiving money as well. The project had what Michael called “a panel of sort-of celebrities” which narrowed the tens-of-thousands of entries to a slate of 21 finalists. The community then voted on the winners from those 21.\nMichael talked about the issues confronted by the team when losers in the contest turned against the site — a much higher volume of nasty blog comments, to the point that the blog became de-emphasized on the site to try to remove the flashpoint. The site also generated some serious victories as well, including the winning project going on to being approved by voters in a Washington state ballot initiative.\nIn the question-and-answer period, numerous participatory media campaigns were offered, including the March of Dimes’ Share Your Story and the Picture the Cure (cached copy, site seems down) initiative for the Canadian Cancer Society. Alan Rosenblatt said Care2 had done a study demonstrating that people who participated in discussion fora were 74% more likely to take action.\nOn to the second session!Marty began by making the argument that the differences in social networks (connections) today — aptly covered by David Weinberger earlier in the day — should necessarily change the way we go about social organizing. It is not as much about building individual leadership or organizational capacity, he said, but about making strong and effective connections.\nIn other words, what would your organization do with 10,000 people for ten minutes?\nMost people today are under a barrage of information. When the FCC’s “Do Not Call” list was launched, 50 million people signed up in just a few weeks — without any advertising whatsoever. These people have “walked away from the current models of civic engagement.” They don’t sign up for email lists because they’re afraid of ever getting off — a barrier to exit becomes a barrier to entry.\nNetwork-centric advocacy focuses not only on the individual or organization, but more importantly on the network “as a mechanism for exerting influence.” Recent political examples of this include the Gray Davis recall campaign, the Howard Dean presidential campaign, and the Network for Justice Against the Death Penalty campaign, which used an innovative evite.com-style model for encouraging people to encourage their friends to sign up (and publicly display the results). A more visual example is ForwardTrack, recently deployed by the Oxygen network in Oh! Speakup!.\nA strong network depends on five key components, according to Marty:\nstrong social ties that become a “tangible, measured and carefully cultivated strategic asset” for organizers a common story that allows the core actors to understand each other a communications grid that allows for one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many conversations, including self-segmentation shared resources for coordinated tasks clarity of purpose and given the context to refine this purpose What networks are particularly good at are:\nconnecting (eBay) sequencing (SETI@Home) synchronizing (flash mobs) distributing (viral news) Additional examples given were MoveOn.org’s Bush in 30 Seconds and the unaffiliated Congress in 30 Seconds — both participatory media campaigns!\nThe session closed with time for people to meet in small groups and discuss network-centric advocacy in the context of their own organizaitons.\nWith that, I’ll leave you with a quote from Marty: “Networks are leaderful and bossless.”\n","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2007/04/notes-ntc-participatory-media-future-online-outreach/","section":"blog","tags":null,"title":"Notes from NTC: Participatory media and the future of online outreach"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/01/","section":"month","tags":null,"title":"Archives: January 2008"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/blog/2008/03/","section":"month","tags":null,"title":"Archives: March 2008"},{"body":"","link":"https://rootwork.github.io/rootwork.org/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"}]
